Embedded Firmware We use definition explained in first chapter of \"Embedded Firmware Solutions\" book by Jiming Sun, Marc Jones, Stefan Reinauer and Vincent Zimmer. Firmware is \"layer of software between the hardware and the operating system (OS), with the main purpose to initialize and abstract enough hardware so that the operating systems and their drivers can further configure the hardware to its full functionality.\" Rising complexity of hardware initialization and need for its manageability created need for BMC (Board Management Controllers), EC (Environmental Controllers) and even more specialized one like USB Power Delivery firmware.

Gathered information can be used for future analysis, debugging and recovery. Optionally scripts upload dump to Dasharo HCL Backup Server, so Dasharo Team can improve open source firmware product line and support customers in case of issues. As temporary solution we use 3mdeb NextCloud as Dasharo HCL Backup Server.

Dasharo Blobs Transmission Unfortunately, some hardware platforms cannot be fully functional without binary blobs in the firmware. Some binary blobs have no EULA or any other license discussing redistributability. To avoid issues, Dasharo Blobs Transmission scripts extract blobs from SPI NOR flash backup and patch Dasharo open-source firmware distribution before initial deployment.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary","text":"After years of providing services and products on firmware market we recognize that it is poisoned by incorrect and confusing terminology.

Docker coreboot needs a specific toolchain to be built, hence why it is usually built inside of a Docker. In case of Dasharo, all images are built using Docker, so you will make sure it works properly on your system. Follow these two links: Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu Post-installation steps for Linux Once you have Docker set up on your machine, you can pull docker images from coreboot/coreboot-sdk (keep in mind that some platforms require older docker images). To pull a Docker image, use: docker pull coreboot/coreboot-sdk:<tag> The typical procedure to build a coreboot image is as follows: git clone https://github.com/Dasharo/coreboot.git cd coreboot git checkout <platform>/release docker run -u $UID --rm -it \\ -v $PWD :/home/coreboot/coreboot -w /home/coreboot/coreboot coreboot/coreboot-sdk:<tag> \\ bash cp configs/config.<platform> .config make olddefconfig make Dasharo Contribution All code review and all issues related to Dasharo are resolved on GitHub . An account there is necessary to contribute and report issues. All Dasharo repositories can be found here . When you have an account on GitHub go ahead and configure an SSH key . It's also highly recommended to configure a GPG key before contributing anything. Instructions to do that can be found here . With that your account should be ready to contribute to Dasharo. Since Dasharo is based on coreboot and edk2, it's best to contribute directly in the upstream if possible. Refer to these documents: contributing to coreboot contributing to edk2 If for some reason you can't contribute your change in upstream repositories, then consider contributing directly to Dasharo. Before doing anything it's best to get familiar with source code structure . To create a patch: fork the repository which you want to edit, in the forked repository: git checkout <platform>/develop (make sure to start from the correct branch), create a new branch: git checkout -b <platform>/<feature> , commit your changes: make sure to sign your commits by using git commit -sm \"<commit_message>\" , <commit_message> should be: path/to/file: Change description , one commit should be one logical change, create a pull request from a fork . Do not forget to check whether patch has been reviewed and changes to your contribution (PR) are needed. If so, remember about answering to each addressed thread with information about change in the commit template: Fixed: <link to commit> example: Fixed 0a2a4ee Dasharo Matrix Space Matrix is a communicator used at Dasharo.

While we understand that cryptocurrencies have gained popularity and recognition in recent years, we have chosen to retain our focus on conventional payment channels. Firstly, we prioritize financial compliance and adhere to EU regulations. Managing cryptocurrencies would require extensive knowledge and resources to ensure compliance, which we are not equipped to handle at our current stage of development. Moreover, the uncertain and evolving nature of cryptocurrency regulations introduces significant risks and potential vulnerabilities. These factors could potentially lead to fiscal audits that could hamper the operations of 3mdeb and impede the progress of Dasharo development. We believe that by adhering to established payment methods, we can ensure a consistent and reliable payment process for our customers. This allows us to maintain a high level of security, accountability, and regulatory compliance.

Press R to rerun test cases, or F to finish. After all, paths to the test results should be displayed in the terminal. By default, they are placed in /home/user/.local/share/checkbox-ng . Additional options run lets you run a particular test plan or a set of jobs, but it does save any results. Example of running one test plan: sudo checkbox-cli run com.canonical.certification::smoke launcher command lets you customize the checkbox experience. To use it, you need to create config_file.ini and start running the checkbox like below: checkbox-cli launcher config_file.ini For more details about these (and others) commands visit checkbox-cli . Troubleshooting When somehow the checkbox stop working you can resume the previous session. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command: sudo checkbox-cli If at least one incomplete session is present on the machine, you should see: Do you want to resume session 'session_title-2022-07-06T13.09.22' ? r = > resume this session n = > next session c = > create new session d = > delete old sessions [ rncd ] : Type in r to resume the stopped session. You can also create a new session or delete an old session by typing the appropriate letter. What do you want to do with that job? s = > skip that job p = > mark it as passed and continue f = > mark it as failed and continue r = > run it [ spfr ] : Decide what you want to do with the last test and type the appropriate letter. After this, your checkbox session will be resumed.","title":"Checkbox certification software usage"},{"location":"common-coreboot-docs/checkbox/#checkbox-certification-software-usage-ubuntu-2204","text":"","title":"Checkbox certification software usage (Ubuntu 22.04)"},{"location":"common-coreboot-docs/checkbox/#introduction","text":"Checkbox is a flexible test automation software.

Disable it if you need access to whole flash with flashrom. Enable SMM BIOS write protection - when enabled, allows only SMM code (the privileged code installed by the firmware in the system memory) to write to BIOS flash. Recommended to be enabled if Firmware setup password is set. Disable the protection if you need access to flash with flashrom. Boot menu enabled - enables/disables ability to enter boot manager menu. Enabled by default. Can be disabled, to prevent from booting from non-default boot media. Early boot DMA Protection - Enables IOMMU DMA protection early during POST. DMA protection is a feature that utilizes the IOMMU early in the boot process to prevent rogue DMA-capable devices such as PCIe add-in cards, USB4/thunderbolt devices from access to memory. This prevents a class of DMA attacks that allow for exfiltration of secrets and installation of malware early in the boot process. Keep IOMMU enabled when transfer control to OS - (only available when Early boot DMA Protection is selected) Keeps IOMMU DMA protection enabled during ExitBootServices when control is passed to the OS. If unsure or see any problems with DMA/IOMMU during OS boot, keep it disabled. NOTE: Windows may not boot if the option is enabled. Networking Options Enable network boot - the option controls if the network boot should be enabled or not. This option is disabled by default on most Dasharo supported devices. When disabled, it prevents loading network controller drivers and unregisters iPXE as boot option (iPXE disappears from Boot Manager and One Time Boot menus) USB Configuration Enable USB stack - controls loading of UEFI USB drivers, when enabled all USB drivers are loaded making USB keyboards and mass storage drives functional in the firmware (to browse setup, press hotkeys or move around bootloaders like GRUB). If disabled no USB device will work before OS is loaded (firmware will not communicate with USB devices). Enable USB Mass Storage driver - this option is blocked if USB stack is disabled. If disabled, UEFI USB Mass Storage driver is not loaded and one cannot boot from USB drives. Essentially this option controls the USB boot capability. It does not affect other devices, like USB keyboards. Intel Management Engine Options This submenu is used to access Intel Management Engine related options. Currently the only option available is Intel ME mode which allows to enable or disable Management Engine: On the right side of the window there is a help section describing the option meaning. If the window is too small, the help section may be divided and not fully shown on the screen. To scroll the help section use D or d keys to scroll down and U or u to scroll up. Intel ME can be disabled in two ways: Disabled (Soft) - when set, causes the Dasharo firmware to send ME_DISABLE command via MEI/HECI. MEI/HECI interface is being hidden from OS when ME is disabled. Disabled (HAP) - when set, causes the Dasharo firmware to set HAP bit in the flash descriptor. MEI/HECI interface is being hidden from OS when ME is disabled. HAP method is much more efficient as it halts the ME firmware execution even earlier than Soft Disable described above When the mode is set to Enabled , Dasharo enables the Intel Management engine by either sending ME_ENABLE command via MEI/HECI or clearing the HAP bit in flash descriptor, depending on the previously active ME mode. MEI/HECI device should be functional in OS when ME is enabled. Any change in the Dasharo firmware setup requires saving the changes and a platform reset (unless specified otherwise). For more information about neutering and disabling ME see also me_cleaner . NOTE: me_cleaner is not supported on all platforms! If a platform supports me_cleaner (i.e. ME version is lower or equal 11.x) it is recommended to set HAP bit and clean the ME region with me_cleaner script permanently. Chipset Configuration The submenu contains general chipset options. Currently available options: Enable PS/2 controller - enables/disables PS/2 controller on the platform. When disabled PS/2 keyboards and mice will stop working in firmware and OS. PS/2 controller will not be functional in OS. This option is not available on laptops where PS/2 is used for the integrated keyboard and possibly touchpad. Enable watchdog - controls the chipset watchdog functionality. If enabled, watchdog will be counting with the timeout specified below. The firmware automatically kicks the watchdog periodically so even without OS support, the platform will not reset itself when watchdog expires. Watchdog timeout value - watchdog timeout in seconds. Allowed range is 60-1024 seconds. The Option is only visible if watchdog is set to enabled. Power Management Options The submenu contains general power management options. Currently available options: Fan profile - Sets of the fan operation modes (defaults to Silent ): Silent - the fan will operate at lower speeds to reduce noise, Performance - the fan will operate at higher speeds, to allow for increased performance. Platform sleep type - sets the active sleep mode to be available for OS Suspend to Idle (S0ix) (default) - also known as modern standby. Select this option if using Windows. S3 sleep mode may not be working well with Windows for machines newer than 11th generation Intel Core processors. S0ix will not work properly if ME is disabled. Suspend to RAM (S3) - standard sleep mode that suspends the machine state to RAM, supported on most operating systems (except Windows on 11th generation Intel Core processors or newer).

Running The Dasharo Tools Suite can be started in various ways. Currently, there are two options: bootable over a network (iPXE), bootable USB stick image. The first one should always be preferred if possible, as it is the easiest one to use. Bootable over a network This section describes how to boot DTS using iPXE. Requirements Below are the requirements that must be met to run DTS over a network on the platform: Dasharo device with DTS functionality integrated, wired network connection, Secure Boot disabled , disabled BIOS lock feature (if device is already flashed with Dasharo). Launching DTS To access Dasharo Tools Suite: attach a wired network cable to the device's Ethernet port, power on the device, holding down the Boot Menu entry key, in the Boot Menu, select the iPXE Network Boot option, in the Network Boot menu, select the Dasharo Tools Suite option, the DTS menu will now appear. Bootable USB stick This section describes how to boot DTS using a USB stick. Requirements Below are the requirements that must be met to run DTS from a USB device on the platform: USB stick (at least 2GB), wired network connection, Secure Boot disabled , disabled BIOS lock feature (if device is already flashed with Dasharo), latest image from releases section. Launching DTS To access Dasharo Tools Suite: flash the downloaded image onto USB stick, you can use a cross-platform GUI installer - Etcher you can also use dd to flash from the command line gzip -cdk dts-base-image-v1.1.0.wic.gz | \\ sudo dd of = /dev/sdX bs = 16M status = progress conv = fdatasync Note: this is an example done on the v1.1.0 image. insert the USB stick into a USB in your device, boot from the USB stick, the DTS menu will now appear. Building We choose Yocto Project to prepare Dasharo Tools Suite system. DTS image can be built using publicly available sources. Thanks to publishing the build cache on cache.dasharo.com the time needed to finish the process should be significantly decreased. Prerequisites The following must be met to build DTS: Linux PC (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ), docker installed, kas-container 3.0.2 script downloaded and available in PATH , wget -O ~/bin/kas-container https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siemens/kas/3.0.2/kas-container chmod +x ~/bin/kas-container meta-dts repository cloned. mkdir yocto && cd yocto git clone https://github.com/Dasharo/meta-dts.git Build From yocto directory, run: SHELL = /bin/bash kas-container build meta-dts/kas.yml Image build takes time, so be patient, and the build's finished, you should see something similar to (tasks number may differ): Initialising tasks: 100 % | ###########################################################################################| Time: 0:00:01 Sstate summary: Wanted 2 Found 0 Missed 2 Current 931 ( 0 % match, 99 % complete ) NOTE: Executing Tasks NOTE: Tasks Summary: Attempted 2532 tasks of which 2524 didn ' t need to be rerun and all succeeded.

Image created with kas-uefi-sb.yml configuration file enable integration of UEFI Secure Boot into DTS using meta-secure-core . Building the image allow to prepare a PoC version with uses sample keys which by no mean should used in production. For user keys the script [create-user-key-store.sh](https://github.com/jiazhang0/meta-secure-core/blob/master/meta-signing-key/scripts/create-user-key-store.sh can be used but it was not tested yet. Quick start with instructions on how to use image are described in meta-efi-secure-boot .

From where you ran image build type. sudo umount /dev/sdx* cd build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64 Here the file dts-base-image-genericx86-64.wic.gz should be available, which is the image of DTS. To flash image, you can use the same command shown in running section . Just change the file name. Boot the platform. Disabling Secure Boot Any procedure affecting the firmware flashing should be preceded by controlling the Secure Boot status and if it is turned on, turning it off. The enabled Secure Boot will not only prevent you from operating on the firmware, but you will also not be able to launch DTS. To check the Secure Boot state: Turn off the station on which you want to test the Dasharo firmware. Turn the station on and go to the next step immediately. Hold the BIOS SETUP KEY to enter the BIOS MENU . Localize and enter the Secure Boot menu using the arrow keys and Enter. Verify that the Secure Boot Status field says Disabled - if not, deselect the Enforce Secure Boot option using the arrow keys and Enter. Change the setting of Secure Boot to Disabled and press Enter. Press the F10 key to open the dialog box. Press Enter to confirm changes and exit from the menu. After completing the steps described above, Secure Boot should be disabled. You could confirm that by repeating steps 3 - 5. Features This section describes the functionality of the Dasharo Tools Suite. These are: Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment , HCL Report , Firmware update , Local firmware update , EC transition , EC update , additional features , run commands from iPXE shell , run DTS using VentoyOS . Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment DTS can be used to flash Dasharo firmware on your hardware. To achieve this, boot DTS, choose option number 2 . After creating report with firmware dump as backup, type p to confirm the installation of Dasharo firmware. Next you will be asked two questions to confirm flashing. The first will be displayed with the detected information about the device you are using DTS on. The second will also provide the hash of Dasharo components which will then be used for flashing. You can compare them with the values listed in the supported hardware section on docs.dasharo.com. Both these questions can be accepted by typing Y . Procedure execution ends automatically on the reboot of the platform (unless it requires otherwise). After restarting the device, you can enjoy the basic version of Dasharo, which we provide for given hardware. This feature is supported on the following platforms: ASUS KGPE-D16, Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010, MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4, MSI PRO Z690-A DDR5, NovaCustom NV4x, NovaCustom NS5x/7x. HCL Report DTS allows the generation of a package with logs containing hardware information. To create one, choose option number 1 and check out the disclaimer. If you would like to send the report to our servers, please remember about connecting the ethernet cable. More information can be found in glossary . HCL Report correctness Please note DTS HCL Report assumes that your chipset is already supported by flashrom. There are also other false negative errors and unknowns, which we trying to fix to improve user experience. Always check results file to confirm the quality of your HCL report. Sample content of such file may look as follows: [OK] PCI configuration space and topology [UNKNOWN] USB devices and topology [OK] Super I/O configuration [UNKNOWN] EC configuration [ERROR] MSRs [OK] SMBIOS tables [OK] BIOS information [OK] CMOS NVRAM [UNKNOWN] Intel configuration registers [OK] GPIO configuration C header files [OK] kernel dmesg [OK] ACPI tables [UNKNOWN] Audio devices configuration [OK] CPU info [OK] I/O ports [OK] Input bus types [OK] Firmware image [OK] I2C bus [UNKNOWN] ACPI tables [OK] Touchpad information [OK] DIMMs information [ERROR] CBMEM table information [ERROR] TPM information [ERROR] AMT information [OK] ME information Results of getting data: Legend: [OK] Data get successfully [UNKNOWN] Result is unknown [ERROR] Error during getting data Please report all errors experienced while performing a dump to dasharo-issues repository. BIOS backup One of the key components of HCL Report is your BIOS backup. To prepare BIOS backup of your platform, simply run HCL Report and decide if you would like to contribute information about your hardware configuration. Please consider the following options depending on your situation: YES - If you decide to contribute, you can always get back to us and ask about BIOS backup, which we will provide after simple verification that you are the owner of the hardware. NO (default) - If you decide to not contribute, your situation depends on the boot method you used to execute DTS: Network Boot - please note that Dasharo booted over iPXE assumes no storage available, so the report, and your BIOS backup are stored in temporary memory and will not be available after reboot. Please make sure to move HCL Report to not volatile storage. This can be done using option 9) Shell , USB Boot - HCL Report and BIOS backup are saved to USB storage root directory. Firmware update DTS can be used to update Dasharo firmware. To achieve this, boot it on platform with flashed Dasharo and choose option number 5 . Next you will be asked two questions to confirm flashing. The first will be displayed with the detected information about the device you are using DTS on. The second will also provide the hash of Dasharo components which will then be used for flashing. You can compare them with the values listed in the supported hardware section on docs.dasharo.com. Both these questions can be accepted by typing Y . If you see the following warning during the process, you do not need to worry about it: Warning: Setting BIOS Control at 0xdc from 0x8b to 0x89 failed. New value is 0x8b.

Warning: Setting BIOS Control at 0xdc from 0x8b to 0x89 failed. New value is 0x8b. SPI Configuration is locked down EC transition DTS allows performing full Embedded Controller firmware transition from the proprietary vendor EC firmware to the Dasharo EC firmware. Currently, this functionality is supported on the NovaCustom NS5x/NS7x ) and NovaCustom NV4x only. Starting from DTS v1.2.0 to perform EC transition please run firmware update on the platform with proprietary vendor EC firmware. EC update DTS allows to update open-source Embedded Controller firmware to the newer version. This is how we can achieve that. Retrieve information about your current EC. system76_ectool info The output of the above-described command should contain information about the version of flashed firmware: board: clevo/ns50mu version: 2022 -08-16_c12ff1a Download the newest version of Embedded Controller firmware. Plug in power supply, without it, flashing EC is not possible as losing power may cause in damaged firmware. Flash Embedded Controller firmware internally. system76_ectool flash ec_file.rom The output of the above-described command should look as follows: file board: Ok ( \"clevo/ns50mu\" ) file version: Ok ( \"2022-08-16_c12ff1a\" ) ec board: Ok ( \"clevo/ns50mu\" ) ec version: Ok ( \"2022-08-31_cbff21b\" ) Waiting 5 seconds for all keys to be released Sync SPI Read 128K Saving ROM to backup.rom SPI Write 128K SPI Read 128K Successfully programmed SPI ROM Result: Ok (()) Sync System will shut off in 5 seconds Sync Note: this is example output, versions may differ Computer will shut down automatically.

Retrieve information about your updated EC. system76_ectool info The output of the above-described command should contain information about the version of flashed firmware: board: clevo/ns50mu version: 2022 -08-31_cbff21b Additional features The section below presents a list of functionalities added to DTS, which were developed at the community's request and which do not necessarily relate strictly to Dasharo. Run commands from iPXE shell Note: this functionality might not work, please see GitHub issue . It is possible to execute the bash script after Linux startup by passing it from the iPXE shell. Every script placed in /sbin/ipxe-commands will be executed automatically after startup. Here is a simple instruction on how to use that feature. Run the HTTP server in the directory which contains the DTS base image. If you build it by yourself, then it should be the meta-dts subdirectory: build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64 . The easiest way to start an HTTP server is using http.server python module. $ python3 -m http.server 9000 Create a dts.ipxe bootchain file in a directory where you have an HTTP server. That file should have similar content (you need to enter the IP of your host machine in a local network). #!ipxe # kernel http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/bzImage root = /dev/nfs initrd = http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/dts-base-image-genericx86-64.cpio.gz initrd http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/dts-base-image-genericx86-64.cpio.gz module http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/custom-script /sbin/ipxe-commands mode = 755 boot Copy your custom-script script in this same directory. Enter the iPXE shell on your device and load dts.ipxe bootchain file. iPXE> dhcp Configuring ( net0 00 :0d:b9:4b:49:60 ) ...... ok iPXE> route net0: 192 .168.4.126/255.255.255.0 gw 192 .168.4.1 iPXE> chain http://192.168.4.98:9000/dts.ipxe http://192.168.4.98:9000/dts.ipxe... ok http://192.168.4.98:9000/bzImage... ok http://192.168.4.98:9000/dts-base-image-genericx86-64.cpio.gz... ok http://192.168.4.98:9000/custom-script... ok Now your custom-script script should be copied to DTS rootfs as ipxe-commands and will be executed after boot. Run DTS using VentoyOS Starting from version v1.1.1 , we provide also an ISO formatted image. Thanks to that, it can be used with VentoyOS[1]. As for now the following limitations are known. VentoyOS needs to be started in UEFI mode. Nothing can be saved on root file system, as VentoyOS boots systems in read-only mode. Please let us know if you started DTS using VentoyOS and have additional information for us. You can share them on Dasharo Matrix Workspace .","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#documentation","text":"","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#supported-hardware","text":"Dasharo Tools Suite was prepared to run on x86 platforms, but we can confirm that it boots on the following platforms: ASUS KGPE-D16, Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010, MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 ( test report ), MSI PRO Z690-A DDR5 ( test report ), NovaCustom NV4x ( test report ), NovaCustom NS5x/7x ( test report ).","title":"Supported hardware"},{"location":"dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#running","text":"The Dasharo Tools Suite can be started in various ways.

It is a set of general rules and tips that you should have in mind while writing guides to any projects in Dasharo repositories. Table of content General rules Document type Useful tools Formatting General rules Make a plan - before starting a new document, you should know how it will look. It is good to prepare a table of content first, and then fill up planned chapters. Read twice before publish - everyone make mistakes. Before committing your changes, it is good to read this again and make sure that you do not make any typos, a dump of commands output is correct, or there are no other mistakes. Goal of document - Documentation is not written for everyone. Some documents contain only a list of commands with minor descriptions, some of them were created to describe research results, and others may be written for non-technical persons with a huge amount of data that are obvious and unnecessary to read by developers. Because of that, you should always know for who you are writing that document - it may be developers, testers, or non-technical management. Hierarchy of information - most important information should always be on top of the document. We should start with the title, short description, and table of contexts. The rest of the chapters should start with the most important one. 30/90 rule - It is good to ask your reporter or someone else to do a quick review where approx 30% of the work was done. At this moment, you probably have prepared the initial draft of the document with a table of content and some remarks about content in planned chapters. The second review should be done when 90% of the work is finished, and the document is almost done. With that workflow, you can make sure that you are on the same page with a reporter. Existing resources - We should not duplicate content that was previously described in another document. Some steps or explanations are related to a few documents, and it is not necessary to write the same again. It is good to use references to existing documents (like hyperlinks) - because of that, updating and maintenance of documentation are easier because the change in one document is related to several others. Also, if you see that a related document is outdated, it will be a much better choice to review and update them instead of writing another new one from scratch. Maintenance - documentation may be outdated after a few changes. We should keep that in mind and prepare an updated schedule. One of the ideas is to mark related documents in every pull request with technical changes. Of course, the best solution is to improve documentation with every change in code/architecture, but it is not always possible due to deadlines or lack of time. Marking documents to update in the future allows us to do that on better occasions - and we prevent situations where the reader must inform us that the documentation is highly outdated - or even useless. Archive - Projects are changing, and some topics from the past are not existing now. If the document describes the working of a non-existing mechanism, we should move it to the special folder with archived content. We can go back to that solution in the future, but it must be moved out to as not to mislead the reader. Document type Good documentation should be written in one of four modes. It can be a tutorial, how-to guide, technical reference, or explanation. These modes were proposed by Diataxis framework, and we want to follow that method in the future. Generally: Tutorials are learning-oriented, and their purpose is to take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. It may be a getting started guide, end2end process, or preparing the working environment. How-to-guides should be written as a step list that is required to solve the problem . They are goal-oriented, which is the main difference between tutorials: how-to guides lead to solving some problems and are not focused on the learning experience. For example, building system images or modifying boot parameters. Reference guides are technical descriptions, and it is information-oriented. It is only information about some technical thing without an explanation of it in the larger context. A good example of that is a requirement list, description of functions or variables used in the program, or list of supported platforms. Explanation is a discussion focused on the understanding of some topic, like boot flow, description of specific communication protocol, or device provisioning. That document should explain the subject, not instruct how to do something. We should not create documents that are not related to these modes. Useful tools grammarly.com - online writing assistant who can improve your grammar and make the document clear. A premium account is a very useful option, but it is not a must. Core functionalities are available for free. It is highly recommended to use the Grammarly tool before committing changes. hemingwayapp.com - make your writing clear. Sometimes it catches things that are not detected by Grammarly. draw.io - we use that to prepare diagrams. paste.dasharo.com - pastebin alternative hosted by Dasharo. asciinema.org - free and open-source solution for recording terminal sessions. Sometimes - especially in more complex cases, it is good to present command sequences in this way. Formatting General rules of formatting documents: Use markdown preview to verify that document is rendering correctly. That feature is available in VS code, Github/Gitlab web IDE, and other tools. Line with code should not have more than 80 characters. To follow that rule, it is good to set the line at width 80 in your IDE. Here is how to do it in VS code. We also maintain the repository Dasharo/dev-tools-configs with editors configs used by our community. Feel free to create PR with your configuration - you can give your proposition to improve existing settings or create configs for editors that don't exist yet in our repository. A properly configurated editor simplifies correct formatting.","title":"Documentation guidelines"},{"location":"dev-proc/documentation-guidelines/#documentation-guidelines","text":"That document can be treated as an onboarding into creating and maintaining documentation in projects developed by Dasharo Team.

The signed-off tends to be dropped (even when using the rebase strategy), which is problematic for some projects (e.g. it makes the coreboot lint checks fail after merging from the UI). The procedure of merging is as follows: Review the code in GitHub. Make sure to receive at least one Approve in the review process. Make sure that all change requests are resolved. Merge the branch using git CLI. In case of merging the feature branch into develop branch it may look as follows: git fetch dasharo git checkout dasharo/<platform>/develop -b <platform>/develop git merge --ff-only dasharo/<platform>/<feature> git push dasharo <platform>/develop This should automatically trigger closing the MR in the GitHub web UI.

Introduction During the 23+ years of coreboot's existence, one aspect that has never been in-depth tested is how its performance compares against proprietary firmware solutions that run on the same hardware platform. The lack of performance testing is because, for most of the interested parties, the selling point of coreboot was the transparency of being open-source, and this rarely made direct comparisons about other features or functionality. Historically, most of what we could find about coreboot performance involves the lower POST times claims, but there needs to be more information regarding its runtime performance as measured in benchmarks, which is a significant point that end users are interested in. Sadly, we need more internal resources and the necessary field experience to conduct such exhaustive benchmark testing. Several significant findings came from third-party benchmarks and community reports, which is enough to know our current standing. Professional hardware reviewers should be better at performing and analyzing measures than we are. Why We Ask To Fine Tune Settings In general, we found out in our limited benchmarking that performance out-of-the-box with Dasharo is measurably lower than performance with MSI proprietary firmware, in the order of 6-8% on the benchmarked Core i5 12600K. Lower performance was quickly tracked down to MSI using, by default, certain processor operating parameters that are quite different from the values stated on the Intel datasheets, resulting in alterations of the processor behavior that allows it to sustain Turbo Boost with higher clock speeds and for longer periods than otherwise possible, and thus appear to perform better overall. After normalizing across both MSI proprietary firmware and Dasharo, the values we found were different, and the benchmark difference was reduced to around 2% (21:19- 29:00) . We also found several review websites that have already written articles and analysis about this matter. Mainboard vendors use default values above those specified by Intel (technically overclocking) to produce better performance results in benchmarks ( AnandTech , TechSpot , VideoCardz , Gamers Nexus about cheating , GamersNexus about MSI default settings , GamersNexus Z490 YouTube Review , TechPowerUp , Tom's Hardware ). Depending on whom you ask, using aggressive values by default can be seen either as a convenience, since the end user gets more performance without having to know how to configure the firmware, or as a form of cheating, due to the end user usually having no idea about these changes and that they are overclocking out-of-the-box. As for the time being, we're sticking to Intel specification default values; these mainboard vendors' custom optimizations hurts us because it makes the difference look much bigger than it is. What we want to showcase is how Dasharo (for this MSI port, coreboot + EDKII UefiPayloadPkg) performance compares against the proprietary firmware codebase. The only way to do so accurately is by ensuring that the hardware operating values are the same in both Dasharo and the original firmware so that the performance differences are not due to higher processor clock speeds thanks to higher Power Limits, unlimited Turbo Boost times, or similar tricks. Note that we are okay with out-of-the-box comparisons, but that wouldn't be directly an apples-to-apples comparison of the performance of both firmware codebases, which is our point. Thus, to make it fair, the hardware has to be tweaked to run with the same operating values on both. As you can't change values on Dasharo unless you're willing to recompile (or ask for a custom build with tweaked values), the easiest way is by bringing MSI firmware values down to Dasharo/Intel levels. Find Your Processor Intel Default Parameters So far we've found six processor-configurable parameters that differ significantly: PL1, PL2, PL1 Tau, ICCMAX, DC_LL, and AC_LL. coreboot uses the values found on two sections of the Intel 12th Generation Intel Core Processors Datasheet (Volume 1 of 2). You will have to check the datasheet to find the proper values for your processor so that you can manually input them onto MSI firmware. In the case of MSI firmware default values, we found no public information, so we only know how it autoconfigures the processors we tested. Note that on the datasheet, Intel doesn't mention processor models by name/number but instead classifies them by amount of P+E cores and Base Power TDP, so first, you have to check these two values from Intel Ark for your processor model, then check on the Datasheet tables what matches both classes to get the Intel default values for the configurable parameters. Here are examples covering the 12400, 12600K, 12900K and 12900KS ( Processor Line Thermal and Power - Package Turbo Specifications (S / HX - Processor Lines) - S-Processor Line LGA ) from this section of datasheet: 12400 6+0 Core 65W PL1 = 65W PL2 = 117W PL1 Tau = 28s 12600K 6+4 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 150W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900K 8+8 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900KS 8+8 Core 150W PL1 = 150W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s VCCCORE DC Specifications - Processor VCCCORE Active and Idle Mode DC Voltage and Current Specifications - Segment S-Processor Line from this section of datasheet: 12400 S-Processor Line (65W) 6+0 -Core ICCMAX = 151A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12600K S-Processor Line (125W) 6+4 -Core ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12900K S-Processor Line (125W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 12900KS S-Processor Line (150W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 1 On S-Processor Line, AC_LL is the same as DC_LL. For reference, on a 12600K, the MSI 1.70 firmware on Auto with CPU Cooler Tuning set to Boxed Cooler (lowest values for auto-configuration) uses the following values vs. Dasharo/Intel defaults: MSI BIOS 1.70 PL1 = 241W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 250A DC_LL/AC_LL = 80 Dasharo 1.1.0 PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 170 Configure MSI Firmware With Intel Default Parameters After you have found your processor model values, you can input them on MSI firmware. Most likely, you want to start from default settings. Enter MSI Firmware, and change the following: Settings Menu (Left Panel) -> Save & Exit Restore Defaults (Confirm Yes) Save Changes and Reboot (Confirm Yes) After the power off/on cycle, enter MSI firmware again, change the following values, then repeat Save Changes and Reboot: OC Menu (Left Panel) -> Advanced CPU Configuration Enhanced Turbo: Disabled (This is MSI name for Multi Core Enhancement) Long Duration Power Limit(W): PL1 Long Duration Maintained(s): PL1 Tau Short Duration Power Limit(W): PL2 CPU Current Limit (A): ICCMAX CPU Lite Load Control: Advanced (Required to input DC_LL and AC_LL as numbers instead of \"Modes\") CPU AC Loadline: AC_LL CPU DC Loadline: DC_LL Miscellaneous Comments Since you can software flash Dasharo and flash MSI firmware again on the same system, you likely want to use the same computer to test both firmware so that no temperature or clock speeds difference could attribute to different pressure on heatsink mounting or silicon lottery. MSI firmware bases its default (Auto) PL1, PL2, and ICCMAX values on the CPU Cooler Tuning set. When using Restore Defaults on a 12600K, this setting defaults to Water Cooler, which allows for technically unlimited PL1 and PL2 (4095W). Even the Boxed Cooler setting configures the 12600K to 241W PL1 and 241W PL2. Thus, you must manually set the individual values for controlled results. So far, the setting that most affected benchmark scores are AC_LL and DC_LL. PL1, PL2 and ICCMAX are limiting. They are only meaningful if the processor gets limited by them, which would depend on the processor model (some have more headroom than others. PL1 is 125W for both 6+4 12600K and 8+8 12900K, the latter would be severely more limited), whereas the other two values are always in effect. On the tested 12600K, the effect of the significantly lower values of AC_LL on DC_LL that MSI uses is a rather massive difference of 20 Watts in power consumption (as reported by ThrottleStop and HWiNFO, and also by lower processor temperatures) when running Cinebench R23. Thus, with MSI values (whenever on MSI or a custom Dasharo build with those), the 12600K doesn't even reach the PL1 limit, allowing it to maintain the highest Turbo Boost clock speeds infinitely, whereas, on Dasharo (or MSI with Intel default values), the extra power consumption makes it to go beyond PL1, eventually throttling back to slower clocks to keep under PL1. LCC (Loadline Calibration Control) is also present in another menu as CPU Loadline Calibration Control, but we left it at Auto. We need to find out if changes in CPU Lite Load Control / CPU AC Loadline / CPU DC Loadline change it or if LCC operates the same regardless of changes to the previous options. The most critical performance-related bug we found in Dasharo involves benchmarking Single Thread applications on Windows 11. With Dasharo, Windows 11 CPU Scheduler likes to move threads around between P and E cores, whereas MSI firmware on the same scenario instead always favors P cores. Such behavior significantly affects the scores of Single-Threaded benchmarks and makes them highly variable depending on which core type a thread spent most of its time. There may be MSRs (Model Specific Registers) related to Intel Thread Director that we aren't aware of that manages this. The only workaround found is to set CPU Affinity manually, which can be performed automatically with Process Lasso, with the bonus of using Forced Mode to continuously re-apply the CPU Affinity settings, as some applications, including Cinebench, like to change them when you start to run the benchmark. Of course, this will not happen on P core, only models like 12400. We did not test manual affinity tested on Linux. Dasharo currently doesn't support manually changing the memory clock speeds, and it will default to the highest standard JEDEC profile supported by the installed memory modules. MSI firmware also defaults to JEDEC profiles, so out-of-the-box, they're matched at memory configuration, thus not a problem. Many enthusiast-grade DDR4 modules use 3200 MHz (maximum supported by Alder Lake-S) or higher and have that clock speed as an XMP profile, whereas the standard JEDEC profile could be just 2133 or 2400 MHz. In most cases, a 3200 MHz DDR4 module will run at lower speeds than expected. There are modules rated for JEDEC 3200 MHz 22-22-22 @ 1.2V that should work in both Dasharo and MSI firmware, in case you're interested in testing this. It is also possible to force Dasharo to use an XMP profile if you're willing to recompile or use a custom build. There are a lot of other settings and MSRs (Model Specific Registers) that we have yet to test. We track the progress of that effort in this issue. Public Alder Lake FSP Integration Guide documents how to set these settings On or Off, but there are few details about how they change the Processor behavior. The remaining 2% of performance will come from matching all these settings. On the public datasheet, there is no DC_LL for the 8+8 150W class, only 8+8 125W, but we can confirm from alternate sources that this is the correct value. \u21a9","title":"Dasharo Reviewers Guide"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#dasharo-reviewers-guide","text":"Based on reviews of Dasharo compatible with MSI Z690-A DDR4/DDR5, we created the following guide to explain the performance gap between MSI proprietary and Dasharo open-source firmware, but in the long run, the same discoveries can apply to other Dasharo and open-source firmware solutions.","title":"Dasharo Reviewers Guide"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#introduction","text":"During the 23+ years of coreboot's existence, one aspect that has never been in-depth tested is how its performance compares against proprietary firmware solutions that run on the same hardware platform.

Professional hardware reviewers should be better at performing and analyzing measures than we are.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#why-we-ask-to-fine-tune-settings","text":"In general, we found out in our limited benchmarking that performance out-of-the-box with Dasharo is measurably lower than performance with MSI proprietary firmware, in the order of 6-8% on the benchmarked Core i5 12600K. Lower performance was quickly tracked down to MSI using, by default, certain processor operating parameters that are quite different from the values stated on the Intel datasheets, resulting in alterations of the processor behavior that allows it to sustain Turbo Boost with higher clock speeds and for longer periods than otherwise possible, and thus appear to perform better overall. After normalizing across both MSI proprietary firmware and Dasharo, the values we found were different, and the benchmark difference was reduced to around 2% (21:19- 29:00) . We also found several review websites that have already written articles and analysis about this matter. Mainboard vendors use default values above those specified by Intel (technically overclocking) to produce better performance results in benchmarks ( AnandTech , TechSpot , VideoCardz , Gamers Nexus about cheating , GamersNexus about MSI default settings , GamersNexus Z490 YouTube Review , TechPowerUp , Tom's Hardware ). Depending on whom you ask, using aggressive values by default can be seen either as a convenience, since the end user gets more performance without having to know how to configure the firmware, or as a form of cheating, due to the end user usually having no idea about these changes and that they are overclocking out-of-the-box. As for the time being, we're sticking to Intel specification default values; these mainboard vendors' custom optimizations hurts us because it makes the difference look much bigger than it is. What we want to showcase is how Dasharo (for this MSI port, coreboot + EDKII UefiPayloadPkg) performance compares against the proprietary firmware codebase. The only way to do so accurately is by ensuring that the hardware operating values are the same in both Dasharo and the original firmware so that the performance differences are not due to higher processor clock speeds thanks to higher Power Limits, unlimited Turbo Boost times, or similar tricks. Note that we are okay with out-of-the-box comparisons, but that wouldn't be directly an apples-to-apples comparison of the performance of both firmware codebases, which is our point. Thus, to make it fair, the hardware has to be tweaked to run with the same operating values on both. As you can't change values on Dasharo unless you're willing to recompile (or ask for a custom build with tweaked values), the easiest way is by bringing MSI firmware values down to Dasharo/Intel levels.","title":"Why We Ask To Fine Tune Settings"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#find-your-processor-intel-default-parameters","text":"So far we've found six processor-configurable parameters that differ significantly: PL1, PL2, PL1 Tau, ICCMAX, DC_LL, and AC_LL. coreboot uses the values found on two sections of the Intel 12th Generation Intel Core Processors Datasheet (Volume 1 of 2). You will have to check the datasheet to find the proper values for your processor so that you can manually input them onto MSI firmware. In the case of MSI firmware default values, we found no public information, so we only know how it autoconfigures the processors we tested. Note that on the datasheet, Intel doesn't mention processor models by name/number but instead classifies them by amount of P+E cores and Base Power TDP, so first, you have to check these two values from Intel Ark for your processor model, then check on the Datasheet tables what matches both classes to get the Intel default values for the configurable parameters. Here are examples covering the 12400, 12600K, 12900K and 12900KS ( Processor Line Thermal and Power - Package Turbo Specifications (S / HX - Processor Lines) - S-Processor Line LGA ) from this section of datasheet: 12400 6+0 Core 65W PL1 = 65W PL2 = 117W PL1 Tau = 28s 12600K 6+4 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 150W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900K 8+8 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900KS 8+8 Core 150W PL1 = 150W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s VCCCORE DC Specifications - Processor VCCCORE Active and Idle Mode DC Voltage and Current Specifications - Segment S-Processor Line from this section of datasheet: 12400 S-Processor Line (65W) 6+0 -Core ICCMAX = 151A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12600K S-Processor Line (125W) 6+4 -Core ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12900K S-Processor Line (125W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 12900KS S-Processor Line (150W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 1 On S-Processor Line, AC_LL is the same as DC_LL. For reference, on a 12600K, the MSI 1.70 firmware on Auto with CPU Cooler Tuning set to Boxed Cooler (lowest values for auto-configuration) uses the following values vs. Dasharo/Intel defaults: MSI BIOS 1.70 PL1 = 241W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 250A DC_LL/AC_LL = 80 Dasharo 1.1.0 PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 170","title":"Find Your Processor Intel Default Parameters"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#configure-msi-firmware-with-intel-default-parameters","text":"After you have found your processor model values, you can input them on MSI firmware.

MSI firmware bases its default (Auto) PL1, PL2, and ICCMAX values on the CPU Cooler Tuning set. When using Restore Defaults on a 12600K, this setting defaults to Water Cooler, which allows for technically unlimited PL1 and PL2 (4095W). Even the Boxed Cooler setting configures the 12600K to 241W PL1 and 241W PL2. Thus, you must manually set the individual values for controlled results. So far, the setting that most affected benchmark scores are AC_LL and DC_LL. PL1, PL2 and ICCMAX are limiting. They are only meaningful if the processor gets limited by them, which would depend on the processor model (some have more headroom than others. PL1 is 125W for both 6+4 12600K and 8+8 12900K, the latter would be severely more limited), whereas the other two values are always in effect. On the tested 12600K, the effect of the significantly lower values of AC_LL on DC_LL that MSI uses is a rather massive difference of 20 Watts in power consumption (as reported by ThrottleStop and HWiNFO, and also by lower processor temperatures) when running Cinebench R23. Thus, with MSI values (whenever on MSI or a custom Dasharo build with those), the 12600K doesn't even reach the PL1 limit, allowing it to maintain the highest Turbo Boost clock speeds infinitely, whereas, on Dasharo (or MSI with Intel default values), the extra power consumption makes it to go beyond PL1, eventually throttling back to slower clocks to keep under PL1. LCC (Loadline Calibration Control) is also present in another menu as CPU Loadline Calibration Control, but we left it at Auto. We need to find out if changes in CPU Lite Load Control / CPU AC Loadline / CPU DC Loadline change it or if LCC operates the same regardless of changes to the previous options. The most critical performance-related bug we found in Dasharo involves benchmarking Single Thread applications on Windows 11. With Dasharo, Windows 11 CPU Scheduler likes to move threads around between P and E cores, whereas MSI firmware on the same scenario instead always favors P cores. Such behavior significantly affects the scores of Single-Threaded benchmarks and makes them highly variable depending on which core type a thread spent most of its time. There may be MSRs (Model Specific Registers) related to Intel Thread Director that we aren't aware of that manages this. The only workaround found is to set CPU Affinity manually, which can be performed automatically with Process Lasso, with the bonus of using Forced Mode to continuously re-apply the CPU Affinity settings, as some applications, including Cinebench, like to change them when you start to run the benchmark. Of course, this will not happen on P core, only models like 12400. We did not test manual affinity tested on Linux. Dasharo currently doesn't support manually changing the memory clock speeds, and it will default to the highest standard JEDEC profile supported by the installed memory modules. MSI firmware also defaults to JEDEC profiles, so out-of-the-box, they're matched at memory configuration, thus not a problem. Many enthusiast-grade DDR4 modules use 3200 MHz (maximum supported by Alder Lake-S) or higher and have that clock speed as an XMP profile, whereas the standard JEDEC profile could be just 2133 or 2400 MHz. In most cases, a 3200 MHz DDR4 module will run at lower speeds than expected. There are modules rated for JEDEC 3200 MHz 22-22-22 @ 1.2V that should work in both Dasharo and MSI firmware, in case you're interested in testing this. It is also possible to force Dasharo to use an XMP profile if you're willing to recompile or use a custom build. There are a lot of other settings and MSRs (Model Specific Registers) that we have yet to test. We track the progress of that effort in this issue. Public Alder Lake FSP Integration Guide documents how to set these settings On or Off, but there are few details about how they change the Processor behavior. The remaining 2% of performance will come from matching all these settings. On the public datasheet, there is no DC_LL for the 8+8 150W class, only 8+8 125W, but we can confirm from alternate sources that this is the correct value. \u21a9","title":"Miscellaneous Comments"},{"location":"guides/logo-customization/","text":"Boot logo replacement instructions Introduction The logo displayed at boot can be customized according to the client's preferences.

Dasharo is registered trademark and product developed by 3mdeb . Dasharo is an open-source firmware distribution focusing on: carefully selected hardware platforms , zero-touch initial deployment , clean and simple code , long-term maintenance , professional support , transparent validation , extensive and structured documentation , privacy-respecting implementation , liberty for the owners and trustworthiness for all . Dasharo consists of productized services , set of open-source repositories , and quality control which help to provide scalable, modular, easy to combine open-source BIOS, UEFI, and firmware solutions. It offers the components that are needed to develop and maintain a high quality, and modular firmware, for the stability and security of your platform. For individuals Dasharo provides optional features in subscription model called Dasharo Entry Subscription . Why 3mdeb created Dasharo? 3mdeb created Dasharo to establish a recognized brand with a proven history of successful firmware integrations. Dasharo aims to deliver added value to customers and the community as an open-source firmware distribution, such as transparent validation, long-term maintenance, bleeding-edge integration for modern hardware, and other products requested by the community and customers. 3mdeb has been providing services related to open-source firmware for years and has been asked multiple times by various parties to create a recognized brand. Therefore, the creation of Dasharo was a move to fulfill that need and establish a marketing vehicle to deliver value to customers. In addition, 3mdeb plans to provide a camp for all coreboot refugees, including platforms moved to branches due to the need for code evolution, such as Intel Intel Quark SoC deprecation and LEGACY_SMP_INIT & RESOURCE_ALLOCATOR_V3 . We want to provide solutions for those requiring long-term maintenance and firmware support. More elaborate explanation of our position you can find below . Dasharo typically supports fully open platforms like Raptor Computing Systems Talos II family, ASUS KGPE-D16 , and other which are not as open but provide modern computing experience, such as MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4/DDR5 . The goal is to provide a reliable, secure, and scalable firmware solution for a wide range of platforms and applications, aligning with the vision of a new golden age of computing advocated by experts in computer architecture. What Dasharo provides? Dasharo has 10 rules that govern the production and release of firmware within its ecosystem. Dasharo rules define what we deliver with every release. These rules are: Every release of firmware produced by Dasharo Ecosystem must contain source code , binary, SHA256 hash, and Dasharo cryptographic signature of that hash. Dasharo Universe contains structured documentation for key activities related to open-source firmware life-cycle: initial deployment, update and recovery. Cryptographic keys hierarchy should be followed: CEO/Founder (GPG fingerint: E030 9B2D 85A6 7E84 6329 E34B B2EE 71E9 67AA 9E4C ) which signs 3mdeb Master Key (GPG fingerint: 1B57 85C2 965D 84CF 85D1 652B 4AFD 81D9 7BD3 7C54 ) which signs 3mdeb Dasharo Master Key (GPG fingerint: 0D5F 6F1D A800 329E B7C5 97A2 ABE1 D0BC 6627 8008 ) which signs Customer Open Source Firmware Release x.y Signing Key (e.g. Novacustom Open Source Firmware Release 1.0 Signing Key) or dedicated 3mdeb keys to given platform. Keys can be found in 3mdeb-secpack repository. Every release of firmware produced by Dasharo Ecosystem must have an attached test report according to requirements. Every test should be described by test specification documentation. Customer-specific Dasharo validation procedures are delivered with the release notes directly to the customer and does not have to be publicly available. Every firmware produced by Dasharo Ecosystem use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 compatible versioning scheme. For details please check description . Every firmware produced by Dasharo Ecosystem should use Keep A Changelog 1.0.0 compatible scheme as changelog format. Every Dasharo firmware release should be delivered with integrity and signature verification procedures. Every Dasharo firmware release must contain a detailed description of components and links to the range of code changes since the last release. Dasharo Ecosystem uses open-source software to create and maintain its firmware solutions, and the company strives to maintain transparency in its processes and procedures. These 10 rules are designed to ensure that every release of firmware produced by Dasharo Ecosystem is reliable, secure, and meets the needs of customers and the community. By following these rules, Dasharo Ecosystem provides a consistent and high-quality firmware solution for a wide range of platforms and applications. What is Dasharo binary blob policy? Modern x86 platforms' firmware requires closed source blobs to be integrated into the image to properly initialize the silicon. The ecosystem is shifting towards designs and technologies with a lot of small microcontrollers and intellectual property (IP) blocks specialized in a very thin range of tasks. Those microcontrollers and IP blocks typically require firmware blobs as well. Some of the blobs are clearly visible, some may be obfuscated and hidden inside the silicon or other firmware blobs (e.g. Intel Management Engine region contains multiple other blobs besides the ME firmware - more about Intel ME blob ). So Dasharo's binary blob policy is as follows: Integrate only the necessary amount of blobs required for proper platform operation and minimize the amount of blobs that are optional whenever possible by providing open equivalent implementations or removing them if there is no functional impact on the platform operation. Ultimately the blobs should be attested and properly documented. Dasharo Team is trying to achieve it by working on firmware SBOMs . Dasharo also works without blobs on platforms that allow that. For example, ASUS KGPE-D16 can run without any blobs (officially there is no PSP on that hardware, and Opteron 6200 series CPUs can run without microcode patches). There is also a libre, POWER9-based server/workstation Talos II by Raptor Computing Systems, which also do not use any binary blobs, however it is more expensive than x86 platforms. Why Dasharo? Open-source firmware ecosystem problems Every open-source project has its own internal dynamics, history and politics. We are always looking for a solution that endorse non-aggression principle and peaceful coexistence, which hopefully will allow everyone to compete based on the same rules. We believe that market is big enough for all players and, if not we should make market bigger, not fight for every possible piece causing collateral damage. Eventually, in the community, we are all human beings, including all our good and bad features. In some cases, sympathy and antipathy cause unexpected dynamics. This impacts every community. We also should be aware that the open-source ecosystem is a place of OPSEC and PSYWAR techniques use, which leads to redirecting energy and resources into directions that make open-source community activity less competitive. In our opinion, massive energy is wasted in the open-source firmware community because of incorrect focus, like religious flame wars about philosophical principles, security paranoia without having an idea of threat modeling, or revolutionary ideas and plans for how to overthrow multibillion-dollar industry overlords. Although we may enjoy discussion during Dasharo open-source firmware vPubs during everyday job would like to focus on delivering value to those who can vote by choosing open-source firmware/hardware/ISA based product to help change the computer industry. Overall there is no economy around open-source firmware, and nobody seems to care much about that. It impacts the upstreaming process, the number of contributors, and reviewers. There are huge players with their own interests, small open-source firmware vendors like 3mdeb and community members essentially working for free. Without middle-size companies standing behind open-source firmware-based products, not much will change. To fill the space between big players and small boutique dev companies, we have to have products with the volume on the market because the hardware market understands only sales volumes, nothing else. We want to work on changing the above paradigms or at least improve the state-of-the-art relation in the community to the level where threats will have a reasonably small impact. We believe that open-source firmware is a critical tool, which should be used consciously to ensure privacy and liberty. What is open-source firmware distribution? Dasharo is 3mdeb's firmware distribution and all its components are open-source. We provide releases in binary form. As you know in most cases on x86 for firmware to be useful it has to cooperate with closed blobs. In all binary releases we are making sure we provide information where all components are coming from. Dasharo works without blobs on platforms that allow that. When we are saying Dasharo open-source firmware distribution we mean code that is delivered by 3mdeb that is open-source. We have no influence on the code provided by 3rd parties (e.g. FSP, ME, GbE etc.). In coreboot community there was some controversy about calling Dasharo open-source firmware distribution (for details please check gerrit review ). We respect coreboot community opinion, so we agreed that in case of coreboot documentation it would be better to use open-source based firmware distribution. It doesn't mean we agree with that decision: Definitions and rules used in coreboot documentation review are not clear. Rules seem not to be applied equally to all contributors of coreboot distribution . Why Dasharo is not called coreboot firmware distribution? While the coreboot is now the default open-source framework for Dasharo, we do not want to limit Dasharo to one framework. We also expect another firmware frameworks to be a base for Dasharo, such as U-Boot , oreboot , Slim Bootloader , or pure EDK II . Moreover, coreboot is not enough in most cases for booting modern computer. Most Dasharo flavors are currently based on coreboot with EDK II payload, but we also have coreboot with skiboot/heads payload, and we expect more flavors to appear in the future. What value Dasharo provides in comparison to coreboot? Dasharo is open-source firmware distribution based on coreboot and other open-source firmware frameworks (e.g. Tianocore EDKII ), you can think about Dasharo and coreboot relation in the same way as you think about Debian/Ubuntu/RedHat and Linux. That means it can provide better cost-effectiveness, security, transparency and customizability than proprietary alternative. There are seven characterestics of Dasharo: carefully selected hardware platforms , zero-touch initial deployment , clean and simple code , long-term maintenance , professional support , transparent validation , extensive and structured documentation , privacy-respecting implementation , liberty for the owners , trustworthiness for all . Dasharo Zero-Touch Initial Deployment Documentation supported hardware provides information about initial deployment, updates and recovery procedures. Developed by Dasharo Team Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS) operating system supports users by automating the deployment process, which helps reducing errors and inconsistencies, and make sure the firmware can be further updated to new version without any problems. DTS also provides controlled and secure environment for initial deployment and update of firmware, reducing the risk of tampering or unauthorized changes. Dasharo Zero-Touch Initial Deployment is smooth, effortless and user-friendly process, which reduces user frustration and improves satisfaction. Use of DTS largely improves firmware adoption, hardware compatibility reporting and binary blobs transmission, as well as recovery. For more details about zero-touch initial deployment please read relevant DTS documentation . Dasharo Clean and Simple Code Dasharo is an open-source distribution project with a simple code structure described in detail here . While the project benefits from the simplicity of the coreboot source code, it is continuously researching and improving its development process and tools to provide a superior experience for developers. One example of this ongoing work is the improvements made to fork maintenance, currently being tracked in this issue on the Dasharo GitHub repository. The project also explores the concept of a bootstrapable toolchain, discussed in the build process section of the project documentation. Dasharo Long Term Maintenance We provide long term maintenance - coreboot community for various reasons, do not merge some patches, because of understaffing, lack of reviewers. Some changes have long way to upstream, we maintain those patches and make them work before those will go upstrea. If ever, we are committed to maintain platforms which are moved to branch in coreboot. Firmware update - we are registered consultants for fwupd/LVFS and enable customers and community platforms, so they can get seamless firmware update in Linux. Dasharo Professional Support Dasharo Support coming in form of three following packages: Dasharo Community Support (DCP) - donation driven development. Dasharo Support Package (DSP) - annual firmware support package. Dasharo Enterprise Package (DEP) - custom SLA, corporate and open roadmap alignment advisroy. The Dasharo Community Support Program is an open-source firmware support initiative that leverages the expertise of community members and developers to improve firmware solutions for a range of hardware models. Platforms in scope of the program should comply with Dasharo quality criteria, which we slowly gather in Dasharo Certification Program . 3mdeb supports and maintains DCP-approved firmware through Dasharo Support Package (DSP) and Dasharo Enterprise Package (DEP). These packages offer essential services like porting to new platforms, developing device drivers, debugging, and fixing bugs. Companies can rely on 3mdeb's expertise to ensure their systems remain secure, up-to-date, and reliable. If you are interested in our services please contact us here . Dasharo Transparent Validation We provide transparent validation results - coreboot in itself provide no guarantees around release quality and do not provide binary distribution (for reference please check coreboot project scope , we provide those in scope of validation we perform. Dasharo Trustworthiness for All We provide ready to use binaries with GPG based signing scheme that improve verification where firmware coming from. What are the differences between the official coreboot repository and the Dasharo repository? Dasharo focuses on specific platforms listed in supported hardware section of Dasharo Universe documentation. Dasharo repository contains release tags which are associated with Dasharo Certification Program providing certain quality criteria including test results. We always trying to minimize delta, but sometimes it can be up to 5k SLOC (or more I guess e.g. Talos II coreboot support). What is Dasharo Certification Program? The Dasharo Certification Program (DCP) is a highly specialized certification program that benchmarks open-source firmware ecosystem deliverables. The program ensures that firmware is stable, secure, and dependable while aligning with the Dasharo values. DCP encourages developers to create their version of Dasharo or contribute to the Dasharo project or coreboot upstream, enabling them to leverage the power of open-source development to create custom firmware tailored to their specific needs based on years of Dasharo quality assurance results. The program's rigorous certification process entails comprehensive testing in the Dasharo Certification Lab, ensuring that the firmware binary meets the strict standards established by the program. By aligning with the Dasharo values, the certification program improves the overall posture of the open-source firmware ecosystem, making it long-term maintainable, sustainable, and trustworthy and providing specific service level agreements and warranties to commercial customers and the community. What is DCP-approved firmware? The Dasharo-certified firmware provides long-term maintenance over ten years after the CPU microarchitecture release, which means that OEM, ODM, hardware vendors, and other companies can rely on the firmware for a long time without worrying about end-of-life issues. Moreover, DCP-approved firmware vendors must provide professional support channels to ensure that other business entities can rely on those channels for long-term support regarding firmware and software. The validation process for DCP firmware is transparent. Test results and bug reports are always publicly available, allowing the community to continually identify issues and improve the firmware. However, in case of a security embargo, the results can be kept under a strict but well-defined policy, ensuring the security of the firmware. Future work These future goals align with the values of privacy, liberty, and trustworthiness in the context of firmware development and the broader tech industry. We would like to implement following features as part of Dasharo Certification Program: Privacy-respecting implementation : By working on solutions that allow users to deactivate potentially malicious components, like ME or PSP, the firmware will respect user privacy and help mitigate data privacy concerns. This approach gives users more control over their devices and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or surveillance. Discussion and more detail in dedicated issue . Liberty for the owners : Respecting the liberty of hardware owners to repair and transfer ownership without risking the leak of personally identifiable data is crucial. This approach supports the right-to-repair movement and ensures that users maintain control over their personal information even when they modify or pass on their devices. Discussion and more detail in dedicated issue . Trustworthiness for all : By publishing known good measurements for each boot phase and storing those measurements in tamper-resistant mediums, such as TPM, during the boot process will increase security and confidence in the firmware. Users and other stakeholders can verify that the firmware executed during the boot process is genuine and uncompromised by making reference measurements publicly available. Discussion and more detail in dedicated issue . Why there is no AMD mainboard supported in Dasharo ? Unfortunately, from the perspective of a small open-source firmware vendor, it isn't easy to work with AMD. Despite our experience with AMD SoCs since 2016, we could not yet deliver Dasharo for a modern (Zen core-based) platform. We're trying hard, but Intel has a better ecosystem for open-source firmware development. The reason for that state may be because AMD is in a rush, and they are understaffed in all areas compared to their success. We've been doing AMD open-source firmware development for 6+ years, including our yearly reports of open-source firmware status at FOSDEM, but the level of support for small volume firmware development companies is not yet at the level of competition. AGESA distribution was a problem in the past, but we solved that, and Dasharo for AMD is possible. Because Dynamic Root of Trust can work without blob, we favor AMD, but we can't do anything without a partner who can sponsor the development effort. We are on the market of open-source firmware vendors, not hardware vendors. Can you port Dasharo to my mainboard? There are other versions of the same questions: Dasharo supports mainboard X; I have mainboard Y (or X'). Can you teach me how to port Dasharo to my mainboard? Can you help me port Dasharo to my mainboard? TL;DR: No, we can't. In Dasharo, we support only carefully selected targets. The answer to that question requires understanding many aspects of the open-source firmware business we learned over the years. The critical point is that we can't help to port arbitrary targets. Hardware has to be carefully selected to bring the most benefits to the open-source firmware community and improve the sustainability of the ecosystem. Random hardware porting lead to an unmaintainable stack of platforms that no one adapts in scale, which does not lead to market change in the correct direction. Lack of commercial adoption is part of coreboot problems as a project, and we would like to avoid this mistake. We have strict criteria based on various aspects explained in Dasharo Community Support section. Dasharo Team tries to select platforms with long-term availability potential. Because we are fully responsible for hardware that we enable in open-source firmware ecosystem, our releases have to pass the Dasharo Certification criteria. The whole effort is relatively expensive and, in most cases, not feasible for enabling one platform. That's why in most cases, our customers are OEM/ODM, angel investors, or communities that need reasonable quantities of hardware (>200pcs). If the board comes with variants with minimal differences required for support in an open-source firmware stack, and one of the variants is part of the Dasharo Support Package, Dasharo Enterprise Package, or Dasharo Community Support, there is a chance to put that hardware on the relevant roadmap. In such a case, don't hesitate to contact us; we will see what we can do. However, the community member who requested support for the platform should also offer their help in validating the firmware and maintenance. That kind of request will be more than welcome from active community members. New members should consider ways to help us to gain a reputation that can lead to influencing Dasharo Community Supported roadmap.","title":"Dasharo"},{"location":"osf-trivia-list/dasharo/#frequenty-asked-questions-about-dasharo","text":"","title":"Frequenty Asked Questions about Dasharo"},{"location":"osf-trivia-list/dasharo/#what-is-dasharo","text":"Dasharo is registered trademark and product developed by 3mdeb .

The ecosystem is shifting towards designs and technologies with a lot of small microcontrollers and intellectual property (IP) blocks specialized in a very thin range of tasks. Those microcontrollers and IP blocks typically require firmware blobs as well. Some of the blobs are clearly visible, some may be obfuscated and hidden inside the silicon or other firmware blobs (e.g. Intel Management Engine region contains multiple other blobs besides the ME firmware - more about Intel ME blob ). So Dasharo's binary blob policy is as follows: Integrate only the necessary amount of blobs required for proper platform operation and minimize the amount of blobs that are optional whenever possible by providing open equivalent implementations or removing them if there is no functional impact on the platform operation. Ultimately the blobs should be attested and properly documented. Dasharo Team is trying to achieve it by working on firmware SBOMs . Dasharo also works without blobs on platforms that allow that. For example, ASUS KGPE-D16 can run without any blobs (officially there is no PSP on that hardware, and Opteron 6200 series CPUs can run without microcode patches). There is also a libre, POWER9-based server/workstation Talos II by Raptor Computing Systems, which also do not use any binary blobs, however it is more expensive than x86 platforms.","title":"What is Dasharo binary blob policy?"},{"location":"osf-trivia-list/dasharo/#why-dasharo","text":"","title":"Why Dasharo?"},{"location":"osf-trivia-list/dasharo/#what-is-open-source-firmware-distribution","text":"Dasharo is 3mdeb's firmware distribution and all its components are open-source.

When we are saying Dasharo open-source firmware distribution we mean code that is delivered by 3mdeb that is open-source. We have no influence on the code provided by 3rd parties (e.g. FSP, ME, GbE etc.). In coreboot community there was some controversy about calling Dasharo open-source firmware distribution (for details please check gerrit review ). We respect coreboot community opinion, so we agreed that in case of coreboot documentation it would be better to use open-source based firmware distribution.

Despite our experience with AMD SoCs since 2016, we could not yet deliver Dasharo for a modern (Zen core-based) platform. We're trying hard, but Intel has a better ecosystem for open-source firmware development. The reason for that state may be because AMD is in a rush, and they are understaffed in all areas compared to their success. We've been doing AMD open-source firmware development for 6+ years, including our yearly reports of open-source firmware status at FOSDEM, but the level of support for small volume firmware development companies is not yet at the level of competition. AGESA distribution was a problem in the past, but we solved that, and Dasharo for AMD is possible.

Can you teach me how to port Dasharo to my mainboard? Can you help me port Dasharo to my mainboard? TL;DR: No, we can't. In Dasharo, we support only carefully selected targets. The answer to that question requires understanding many aspects of the open-source firmware business we learned over the years. The critical point is that we can't help to port arbitrary targets. Hardware has to be carefully selected to bring the most benefits to the open-source firmware community and improve the sustainability of the ecosystem. Random hardware porting lead to an unmaintainable stack of platforms that no one adapts in scale, which does not lead to market change in the correct direction. Lack of commercial adoption is part of coreboot problems as a project, and we would like to avoid this mistake. We have strict criteria based on various aspects explained in Dasharo Community Support section. Dasharo Team tries to select platforms with long-term availability potential. Because we are fully responsible for hardware that we enable in open-source firmware ecosystem, our releases have to pass the Dasharo Certification criteria. The whole effort is relatively expensive and, in most cases, not feasible for enabling one platform. That's why in most cases, our customers are OEM/ODM, angel investors, or communities that need reasonable quantities of hardware (>200pcs). If the board comes with variants with minimal differences required for support in an open-source firmware stack, and one of the variants is part of the Dasharo Support Package, Dasharo Enterprise Package, or Dasharo Community Support, there is a chance to put that hardware on the relevant roadmap. In such a case, don't hesitate to contact us; we will see what we can do. However, the community member who requested support for the platform should also offer their help in validating the firmware and maintenance. That kind of request will be more than welcome from active community members. New members should consider ways to help us to gain a reputation that can lead to influencing Dasharo Community Supported roadmap.","title":"Can you port Dasharo to my mainboard?"},{"location":"osf-trivia-list/deployment/","text":"Deployment Deployment section of Dasharo Knowledge Base FAQ considers topic of open-source firmware deployment, which may include operations of reading and writing SPI NOR flash, as well as binary modifications.

Flashrom Following sections explain how to deal with most common flashrom problem. How to install Dasharo flashrom fork ? Install flashrom v1.1 or newer with your distribution's package manager if you don't have it installed yet. If your distro doesn't provide flashrom or provides an outdated one, you can build it yourself using this instruction . Or compile recent version of flashrom: If you need flashrom for Dasharo-supported hardware and for some reason you cannot use DTS, please consider the compilation of Dasharo flashrom fork . For compilation details and related issues, please check flashrom documentation and community . Perform dry run to detect the problems early Most of the problems can be detected early and avoided without attempting to flash the firmware. You may check for most of the errors described here by doing a dry run (not passing any firmware binary): sudo flashrom -p internal In below sections there are example errors that you may find in the output of above command. Could not get I/O privileges (Operation not permitted) If you see a flashrom error like this: ERROR: Could not get I/O privileges (Operation not permitted). You need to be root. Error: Programmer initialization failed. It means you have insufficient privileges to perform initialization. Please use sudo before flashrom command. /dev/mem mmap failed: Operation not permitted /dev/mem mmap failed: Operation not permitted FAILED! FATAL ERROR! Error: Programmer initialization failed. Linux kernel restricts access to IOMEM. To fix that add iomem=relaxed to the kernel command line. Recommended way to fix the problem: Edit /etc/default/grub : GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX = \"iomem=relaxed\" Update GRUB2 config with: sudo update-grub2 Alternatively, if previous command doesn't work: sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg Reboot and try flashrom command again Other method: Edit grub.cfg in /boot/grub/ : linux /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-115-generic ro quiet iomem = relaxed Reboot and try flashrom command again Last resort you can try to modify boot option runtime. YMMV: If your computer uses BIOS for booting, then hold down the Shift , or if your computer uses UEFI for booting, press Esc several times, while GRUB is loading to get the boot menu. And, after getting a GRUB menu, press E on a boot entry to append iomem=relaxed to kernel command line and press Ctrl + X or F10 to boot. Although this setting is temporary and will last only during the next boot, this way is faster and a customer doesn't need to re-generate anything. Please note having it as a temporary setting maybe is slightly better for security (there's a reason why it's disabled by default) . If the above does not resolve the problem, the kernel may be compiled with strict devmem, which prohibits accessing the IOMEM. You should then take different Linux system.

Reproducible Builds and a lot of its aspects is well explained on the linked website. Why are reproducible builds crucial OSF? This is because knowing hashes of firmware components, we can calculate expected TPM PCRs values. By knowing good PCR values and being able to predict further values after firmware update, we are gaining the following advantages: We can easily confirm if the firmware is valid by reading TPM PCRs and compare to reference integrity measures (RIM), RIM can be calculated by build exactly the same version of OSF. NOTE : Please note that depending on your threat model using TPM chip with closed source firmware implementation may lead to solution which is not trustworthy. Process of replying measurements provided in TPM Event Log is simpler because we can easily obtain software and confirm hashes used during PCR extension the process was valid and the same as produced by the software build process Looking for bugs by using bisection is easier since being able to build every commit of software in a reproducible manner give us confidence that there would be no change in behavior between 2 consecutive builds Consistent behavior for given hash can be confirmed by test results tied to given hash in that way users looking at test results may expect exactly the same behavior for firmware binaries with the same hash Long term maintenance should be easier if firmware build would be reproducible over a long time, because often happen some firmware land in industrial applications, e.g., robots, trains, smart city infrastructure, if the bug will be detected after a long time; it is important to have tools and be able to confirm the same binary can be generated in the future. If we know given toolchain reproduce binary bit by bit we are sure it also reproduces software/firmware behavior. In that light making small incremental improvement using a toolchain that gives reproducible results give us higher the chance that we will not introduce uncontrolled change in behavior and code the change will be reflected by the compilation process without affecting previous software behavior. [OSFI0011] Docker containers as build systems \"considered harmful.\" Docker containers for a couple of last years become the default method for providing reproducible runtime environment for software as well those started to be very useful for developers to transfer exact configuration for building given software stack. We wrote about the usefulness of Docker containers in embedded software development environment on 3mdeb blog . After a long time of using Docker containers for embedded software development and build environments we noticed problems for long time maintenance and reproducibility. coreboot-sdk problems The example can be coreboot-sdk used for building coreboot project . A good summary of the problem was provided by Thrilleratplay in guix-docker repo : Currently, the coreboot build environment, coreboot-sdk , uses a Debian docker base image. To install additional required packages, apt-get update must be run. The resulting Docker image is hosted in the Docker hub repository to be retrieved at any time in the future. However, at any time in the future, building the same docker file will generate a different image based on the latest packages used in apt-get. Over time, as packages are updated due to bug, security or feature improvements, the docker image's provenance in the docker hub repository becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to audit and reproduce. Some more detailed notes related to coreboot-sdk issues are presented below. There is no meaningful versioning of SDK [1] - at some point, there was versioning 1.32-53, now switched to git SHA. Both seemed to have no meaning and were released at arbitrary points in time. The result is that it is hard to find which version of SDK works with the coreboot tree version. Validation of coreboot-sdk is not sufficient - for example, recently, python fixes were merged [2] , somehow this change passed all QA checks, but SeaBIOS use python (not python2 or python3) and all builds using this version of SDK that compile SeaBIOS fail. coreboot-sdk is based on moving target Debian sid. It is close to impossible to build the same Docker images at 2 different points in time. coreboot-sdk enforce given version of ACPI spec - this may not always be a good thing to use the most recent compiler and update code accordingly since it can easily break OSes. Why we care? Whenever we deliver code or service to community or customer, we provide build environment which, for the sake of quality user support, should be stable. CI pipelines rely on those containers. Replacing docker image in CI pipeline whenever something change defeat the purpose of having automation and increase maintenance cost significantly and increase maintenance cost significantly Requirements for OSF dev and build process Open-source firmware development and build environment SHOULD have: * meaningful release process * meaningful validation process, at least basic build system and dev env capabilities should be tested * meaningful revisions with a clear explanation of what software stack can be build with what version of dev and build system, a description should include side-spec compliance, e.g., ACPI, SMBIOS, UEFI, etc. * reproducible process that works across systems and in the long run * signature, so anyone can identify where build and dev env coming from and if it is trustworthy Ideas for solving the above issues Docker images are not reproducible - this is a known fact, and if we are extremely serious about stability, security and quality, we should stop using a not reproducible build environment. Of course, there is some work making Docker images reproducible, but it opens Pandora's box [3] of Yocto or Buildroot. Another path could be Nix or Guix, which is currently pursued in the community OSFW #guix-buildstack channel this is a private channel; feel free to ping anyone from 3mdeb Team to join. coreboot toolchain is built by its own build system, which would be hard to couple with Dockerfile or something else. Docker images can be signed using docker trust commands as described here . Other idea would be to use wget and dpkg -i for every needed package in Dockerfile that create base image for reproducible toolchain. Of course that means quite extensive dependency management, but maybe simplicity is worth the effort. It is also possible to maintain VMs per given coreboot (or other OSF) version. That may mean long term VM image compatibility issues as well as problems with making sure images would work with various hypervisor versions. It is even more complex if multiple OS should be supported. VMs also have quite big overhead in terms of performance I'm not tracking all activity in the community, so some claims may be plain wrong. Please let me know what I miss when I'm wrong.","title":"Firmware build process"},{"location":"osf-trolling-list/build_process/#osfi001-build-process","text":"","title":"[OSFI001] Build process"},{"location":"osf-trolling-list/build_process/#osfi0010-there-is-no-healthy-osf-without-reproducible-builds","text":"","title":"[OSFI0010] There is no healthy OSF without reproducible builds"},{"location":"osf-trolling-list/build_process/#osfi0011-docker-containers-as-build-systems-considered-harmful","text":"Docker containers for a couple of last years become the default method for providing reproducible runtime environment for software as well those started to be very useful for developers to transfer exact configuration for building given software stack.

UEFI capsule update is an industry-standard approach widely supported by hardware vendors, providing a secure and reliable method for delivering firmware updates. By adopting UEFI capsule update methods, the project aims to simplify the update process and enhance the user experience, providing a more secure and reliable approach compared to complex flashrom-based updates, which are still common in the open-source firmware distributions based on coreboot. Due to security measures, OS-level access to firmware is intentionally restricted, which in turn makes it increasingly challenging to apply firmware updates from the operating system. This limitation poses difficulties in utilizing traditional flashrom-based methods for firmware updates. The expected outcomes of the project include enhanced firmware update capabilities, a simplified user experience, heightened security, and enhanced compatibility, all achieved by seamlessly integrating with fwupd, a popular firmware update management tool for Linux systems. Involvement with projects or organisations relevant to this project Relevant projects: coreboot [1] Dasharo compatible with MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 (and the subsequent port for the DDR5 variant) [2] Dasharo compatible with Dell Optiplex [3] EDKII [4] Fwupd (LVFS) [5] U-Boot [6] 3mdeb has been a licensed provider of quality coreboot consulting services since 2016. We are well-known in the open-source community for maintaining th firmware of the PC Engines APU series platform since 2016, delivering high-quality firmware releases each month and providing technical support on PC Engines and OPNSense forums. Our contribution to the coreboot project reaches (as of 26th of July 2023): 319 individual patches merged to the official coreboot repository 33481 lines of code added 41097 lines of code removed Moreover, we constantly develop Dasharo, which is an open-source firmware distribution focusing on clean and simple code, long-term maintenance, transparent validation, privacy-respecting implementation, liberty for the owners, and trustworthiness for all. More details can be found here [7] . Project scope Task 1. Enable Capsule Updates in coreboot This task aims to enhance the coreboot framework by adding support for UEFI Capsule Update. Enable memory access above 4GB Modify coreboot to operate in 64-bit mode and enable access to memory above the 4GB limit. Parse capsule location from UEFI variables in coreboot Implement a mechanism for coreboot to identify the memory location of the capsule images from drivers to UEFI variables. This milestone ensures accurate retrieval of capsule images by coreboot. Gather capsules into one region Rewrite the existing capsule coalescing logic to consolidate all firmware update capsules into a single memory region. Reserve memory containing capsules and pass it to the payload Implement the necessary changes in coreboot to reserve the memory region containing the capsules. Pass this information to the UEFI payload using the Hand-Off Block (HOB) data structure. Add SMI handler for flashing firmware updates Implement a handler able of writing to SPI flash. Similar handler already exists, but it is limited to SMMSTORE region, used to implement secure UEFI variables. New handler would allow to overwrite whole BIOS image, so it must not be enabled unless a valid capsule update is present. Task 2. Enable capsule updates in coreboot EDK II UEFI Payload The UEFI payload integration task involves integrating the enhanced coreboot firmware with the UEFI system. Additionally, parsing the version reported by coreboot and incorporating it into the EFI System Resource Table (ESRT) ensures accurate tracking of system firmware updates. These integrations enhance firmware reliability, provide advanced update capabilities, and enable a seamless user experience. Implement PlatformFlashAccessLib leveraging coreboot SMI handler Create a library instance that enables flash access operations within the UEFI platform with the help of SMI handler implemented in coreboot. Modify FDF/DSC files and capsule processing Update the Firmware Descriptor (FDF) and Device Scope Configuration (DSC) files. Enable boot mode selection and invoke ProcessCapsules() at the necessary stages during the firmware update process. Parse version reported by coreboot for ESRT Extract coreboot version information and incorporate it into the EFI System Resource Table (ESRT) within UEFI, to reflect the updated firmware and prevent rolling back to earlier versions. Develop process for building capsules from coreboot.rom Establish a streamlined workflow to generate capsules containing the coreboot.rom image and automate the process where possible. Task 3. Test the solution on a hardware In this task, the UEFI Capsule Update will be tested on the hardware to ensure its proper functionality and compatibility. Verify feature using test signing keys Validate the CAPSULE_ENABLE feature using test signing keys before using product-specific signing keys. OS block booting verification Test a mechanism that prevents the operating system from booting until a reboot occurs after the firmware update process. The primary objective is to ensure that the system remains secure and stable after firmware updates are applied. Task 4. Secure Firmware Signing In this task the focus is on implementing secure firmware signing processes to ensure the integrity and authenticity of firmware updates. The use of OpenSSL utilities for generating signing keys enhances security, while the developed binary compilation procedure simplifies the signing process for end-users. Generate signing keys using OpenSSL utilities Utilize OpenSSL command line utilities to generate the necessary signing keys for the capsule update process. Develop binary compilation without using a private key This milestone involves creating a comprehensive procedure for users, outlining the process of signing binaries without the use of a private key, ensuring a consistent and efficient signing process. End-user documentation Create comprehensive documentation for end-users, including detailed instructions on how to perform firmware updates and utilize the provided features effectively. Task 5. Enhanced Boot Process with vboot A/B Support This task aims to establish a more secure, stable, and user-friendly firmware update process. The incorporation of the vboot A/B scheme will provide a reliable fallback in case of problematic updates, while the automated execution of the UX capsule will enhance the end-user experience during firmware updates. Add support for the vboot A/B scheme Enhance the firmware update mechanism to support the vboot A/B scheme, providing a fallback option in case of unstable updates. Automate the creation and execution of the UX capsule Use UX capsule to convey message to the user that the update is in progress. Because update takes significantly more time than normal boot, impatient user may think that the boot process is stuck and try to force a platform reboot, which in turn may end up with non-working platform. Task 6. Test and release UEFI Capsule Update for coreboot and EDK II Task 6 involves testing and release of firmware updates for both MSI PRO Z790-P and MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4/DDR5 platforms. The primary focus is to verify the successful update process, ensuring system stability and security after applying the new firmware update method. Test and publish release for MSI PRO Z790-P Verify the successful update process and ensure system stability and security after applying the new firmware update method. Test and publish release for MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4/DDR5 Verify the successful update process and ensure system stability and security after applying the new firmware update method. Task 7. Upstream of the UEFI Capsule Update for coreboot with EDK II in coreboot The primary objective is to merge the UEFI Capsule Update functionality directly into the coreboot codebase, ensuring its availability as part of the coreboot project and expanding the firmware update capabilities for coreboot-supported systems. The code implementing UEFI Capsule Update for coreboot with EDK II shall be upstreamed to the official coreboot repository at https://review.coreboot.org/. Task 8. Upstream of the UEFI Capsule Update for coreboot with EDK II in EDK II The goal is to ensure that the UEFI Capsule Update implementation becomes a part of the official codebase, contributing to the wider EDK II ecosystem and enhancing the firmware update capabilities for coreboot-supported systems. The code implementing UEFI Capsule Update for coreboot with EDK II shall be upstreamed to the official EDK II repository at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.

This integration requires understanding and implementing the UEFI specification, especially the EFI_FIRMWARE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL, FMP capsule format, and EFI System Resource Table (ESRT). Adapting coreboot and EDK II to support these mechanisms will involve extensive code changes and ensuring compatibility with the UEFI standard. Solving these challenges will involve significant code modifications, rigorous testing, and an active collaboration with the coreboot and EDK II communities to ensure successful integration and smooth functionality. Ecosystem of the project Although 3mdeb will be responsible for the whole implementation and testing, anyone is also welcome to test, develop code, and report issues after the results will be published. For the project to be successful, the outcomes should be included in the upstream coreboot and edk2 projects for the benefit of the wider community. That is why we expect high level of engagement with communities of both of this projects at each stage of the project, to make sure the proposed solution can be accepted upstream.

We're excited to share our plans to integrate the TrenchBoot Project into Qubes OS's new Anti-Evil Maid (AEM) implementation. As you may know, traditional firmware security measures like UEFI Secure Boot and measured boot, even with a Static Root of Trust (SRT), may only sometimes be enough to ensure a completely secure environment for your operating system. Compromised firmware may allow for the injection of malicious software into your system, making it difficult to detect. To overcome these limitations, many silicon vendors have started implementing Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) technologies to establish a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. We're excited to take advantage of these advancements through integration with the TrenchBoot Project . The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs . In open-source projects, DRTM hasn't found its place yet, but that gradually changes. The demand on having firmware independent Roots of Trust is increasing and projects that satisfy this demand are growing, for instance, TrenchBoot . TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to build security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their systems. The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs) that establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of confidence that integrity actions were not subverted is derived. The project has grown a lot thanks to the previous NLnet NGI0 PET grant and now it looks for further expansion into extensive use of the DRT technologies in open-source and security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS . Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid (AEM) software heavily depends on the availability of the DRTM technologies to prevent the Evil Maid attacks . However, the project hasn't evolved much since the beginning of 2018 and froze on the support of TPM 1.2 with Intel TXT in legacy boot mode (BIOS). This effectively limits the usage of this security software to older Intel machines only. TPM 1.2 implemented SHA1 hashing algorithm which is nowadays considered weak in the era of forever-increasing computer performance and quantum computing. The solution to this problem comes with a newer TPM 2.0 with more agile cryptographic algorithms and SHA256 implementation by default. Qubes OS AEM software suffers from the following: Lack of TPM 2.0 support to handle more secure hashes and safer design of the TPM firmware according to a newer specification. Qubes OS AEM has never supported any AMD processors with AMD Secure Startup technology. Implementing AMD support would make a huge impact and broaden the usage of DRTM technologies. The initial AEM implementation relied on the Trusted Boot project , Intel's reference implementation of Intel TXT. It had never any plans to support AMD processors. TrenchBoot is filling this gap supporting both Intel and AMD hardware which makes it an ideal target to replace Trusted Boot in Qubes OS AEM implementation. Furthermore, the project grant would be used to implement the missing pieces in the Qubes OS AEM software to cover the AMD and Intel support for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0.

Among them, the Anti Evil Maid was frequently presented by 3mdeb engineers: Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform Anti Evil Maid for modern AMD UEFI-based platform 3mdeb, with financial support from Qubes OS, developed a proof of concept replacing Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2. Qubes OS and 3mdeb already tested a new solution with Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid, which is available for community use. The result of this solution can be seen in the published blog post that concludes the first phase of integrating TrenchBoot Anti Evil Maid for Qubes OS. The numbering of the next phases of the project will commence with number 2 in order to maintain consistency with the work already completed in phase 1 . The following application describes the remaining work required to have production quality adoption in one of the most popular secure operating system on the market. What are the significant technical challenges you expect to solve First of all Qubes OS AEM software consists of software packages providing Trusted Boot and the Qubes OS TPM scripts . These software packages would need to replace the Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot supported GRUB2 and Xen. Secondly, the TPM scripts require adding support for TPM 2.0 equivalent functionality. AEM requires access to non-volatile RAM inside TPM which is defined differently in the TPM 2.0 specification compared to TPM 1.2. Another challenge would be to update the TrenchBoot components for AMD platforms to the recent boot protocol, which will allow AMD platforms to take advantage of the QubesOS AEM feature, and TrenchBoot. Requested support Phase 2 - TPM 2.0 support in Qubes OS AEM (Intel hardware): Implement support for TPM 2.0 module in Xen Required to measure Dom0 kernel and initial ram disk before they are executed. Implement support for TPM 2.0 event log in Xen Required to log the Dom0 kernel and initial ram disk hashes to the TPM event log. The event log could be used for future system attestation. Implement parallel CPU cores bring-up for DRTM launch Currently the CPU cores are being woken up in parallel, but later they are hacked to be waiting in a queue. If any interrupt would come at that time, it could be a serious danger. It has to be fixed as soon as possible, as required by Intel TXT specification. Integrate TPM 2.0 software stack into Qubes OS Dom0 Extend the AEM scripts to detect TPM version on the platform While AEM fully supports TPM 1.2 there is no support for TPM 2.0 at all. When the TPM family is determined the script should use the appropriate software stack for given TPM. The task implements the AEM TPM 1.2 equivalent functionalities using TPM 2.0 software stack and as a result allowing the use of TPM 2.0 with Qubes OS AEM. It will require implementing the access to TPM 2.0 NVRAM, sealing and unsealing the secret data and generating TOTP. Extend the AEM scripts to use appropriate software stack for TPM 2.0 Currently, only TPM 1.2 is supported in Qubes OS AEM service code. The 3 items above will ensure the necessary software for TPM 2.0 is available and AEM scripts executed early from the initrd can detect which TPM family is present on the platform and use appropriate software stack and functions. TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 software stacks are not compatible so the scripts themselves must use proper API for given TPM and its respective software stack. Update Qubes OS AEM documentation Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2 and 2.0 using legacy boot mode Phase 3 - Update to the newest TrenchBoot boot protocol: Code rebase onto the most recent work implementing Secure Launch protocol being upstreamed to Linux and GRUB The current state of TrenchBoot support has diverged with what was developed for QubesOS AEM for Intel hardware with TPM 1.2. The task aims to update the work and align with the TrenchBoot boot protocol being upstreamed to GRUB and Linux kernel. Xen shall take similar approach as Linux kernel in terms of DRTM launch. Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 using legacy boot mode Phase 4 - AMD support for Qubes OS AEM with TrenchBoot: Update the Secure Kernel Loader (formerly LandingZone) package support for QubesOS Since the initial work done by 3mdeb engineers for AMD AEM in Qubes OS a lot of time has passed and Secure Kernel Loader - SKL (formerly Landing Zone) has improved a lot and added new features. SKL is an open-source module written by TrenchBoot developers required by AMD Secure Startup technology to perform DRTM launch. The task aims to refresh the previous work and update the SKL package for Qubes OS to the newest revision. TrenchBoot Secure Kernel Loader (SKL) improvements for AMD server CPUs with multiple nodes While SKL was extensively tested on System on Chip and single CPU platforms, it was not much tested on workstation/server segment CPUs which are more complex. For example one server CPU package may contain two independent CPUs inside called nodes. Each node will enable protection on the SKL during DRTM execution. This protection has to be disabled on each node when TrenchBoot DRTM tasks are done. The task implements the correct support for server CPUs in TrenchBoot SKL. Update TrenchBoot boot protocol for AMD in GRUB2 Some work to implement TrenchBoot support for Qubes OS on AMD hardware has been done. GRUB2 with TrenchBoot support has been added to Qubes building system on 3mdeb fork . The task aims to update the work and align with the TrenchBoot boot protocol being upstreamed to GRUB2 and Linux kernel. Update TrenchBoot boot protocol for AMD in Secure Kernel Loader The task aims to update the TrenchBoot boot protocol for AMD platforms in Secure Kernel Loader and align with the TrenchBoot boot protocol being upstreamed to GRUB2 and Linux kernel.

Please use the current version of the plan for up-to-date information Abstract The firmware is the heart of the security of a given system and should always be up-to-date to maintain the computer's security. However, being up to date does not prevent the firmware vulnerabilities from appearing. The Static Root of Trust (SRT) like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot and measured boot provided by the firmware is not always sufficient to establish a secure environment for an operating system. If the firmware is compromised, it could inject malicious software into operating system components and prevent the machine owner from detecting it. Silicon vendors implement alternative technologies to establish a Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) to provide a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. Either from SRT or DRT, these integrity measurements can be used for operating system attestation. However, DRT technologies are designed to provide the ability to establish a secure environment for integrity measurements at any arbitrary point of time instead of relying on the firmware, which requires machine reset to establish the aforementioned secure environment. The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs . DRTM hasn't found its place in open-source projects yet, but that gradually changes.

Among them, the Anti Evil Maid was frequently presented by 3mdeb engineers: Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform Anti Evil Maid for modern AMD UEFI-based platform A similar approach was already tried by Assured Information Security (AIS) to boot Xen in UEFI mode with Intel TXT DRTM technology . However, this is only a tiny portion of the work covered by our proposal. Additionally, Qubes OS does not launch using Xen.efi like in the AIS work but uses Multiboot2 protocol with GRUB2 instead, making this approach unusable. Moreover, the Xen.efi approach is much more complex and assumes usage of Trusted Boot, limiting the feature to Intel hardware only. What are the significant technical challenges you expect to solve First of all, Qubes OS AEM software consists of software packages providing Trusted Boot and the Qubes OS TPM scripts . These software packages would need to replace the Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot supported GRUB2 and Xen. Secondly, the TPM scripts require adding support for TPM 2.0 equivalent functionality. AEM requires access to non-volatile RAM inside TPM, which is defined differently in the TPM 2.0 specification compared to TPM 1.2. Another challenge would be to make Xen possible to boot in UEFI boot mode without Boot Services defined in UEFI specification. Boot Services are a set of functions exposed in UEFI structures that are used to help with handling the boot process. However, the main principle of DRTM technologies is to not depend on any external code that is not a part of the operating system software to be executed after DRTM. UEFI Boot Services are a part of the firmware of which DRTM tries to be independent. The whole security concept of DRTM depends on cutting the ties with firmware. Thus the work includes implementing the capability in Xen not to use the UEFI Boot Services, which GRUB2 would terminate before DRTM is executed. Xen also contains an option not to use the UEFI Runtime Services. Runtime Services is a set of functions available throughout the whole machine lifetime, which means some firmware functionalities are available even when the operating system is launched. Removing the Boot Services from Xen brings certain drawbacks to the system because the Boot Services hold essential information like memory map, TPM event log, graphics framebuffer, etc. This information must be extracted by GRUB before Boot Services are terminated and passed to the Xen. The proposed solution is to pass this information via the Multiboot2 tags defined in the specification for this particular Boot Services information. Another challenge would be to get the work merged in the upstream repositories. It would ensure the long-term support and maintenance of the solution and availability. Providing software packages to be used out of the box is crucial for technology availability. Requested support Phase 1: TrenchBoot Intel TXT and TPM 1.2 support Add TPM 1.2 support for Intel TXT in TrenchBoot GRUB2 The TrenchBoot support hasn't been implemented and verified with TPM 1.2 on Intel TXT path. This requirement ensures that the TPM 1.2 is also supported for older Intel hardware with Intel TXT. Xen Secure Launch - Intel TXT support in Xen for TrenchBoot Due to the requirements of Intel TXT and how it is utilized, it is impossible to use the Xen boot protocols defined in the UEFI or Multiboot2 specifications. This task aims to create a custom Intel TXT entry point for Xen, which would hand off to the standard Multiboot2 entry point and enable the direct launch of Xen by GRUB via DRTM on Intel hardware. Additionally, there is no support for launching Xen with Intel TXT other than Trusted Boot. It has to be ported from Trusted Boot specific code: constructing MLE header waking up APs restoring MTRRs reserving the TXT memory reenabling SMIs handling TXT shutdown and S3 resume/suspend TPM event log finding Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2 with legacy boot mode Phase 2 - Qubes OS AEM TPM 2.0 support: Extend the AEM scripts to detect TPM version on the platform As TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 use different software stacks and tools, it is necessary to distinguish the TPM module family and use the appropriate software. The task will implement the logic to distinguish the TPM families. Extend the AEM scripts to use the appropriate software stack for TPM 2.0 While AEM fully supports TPM 1.2, there is no support for TPM 2.0 at all. When the TPM family is determined, the script should use the appropriate software stack for the given TPM. The task implements the AEM TPM 1.2 equivalent functionalities using TPM 2.0 software stack and as a result allowing the use of TPM 2.0 with Qubes OS AEM. It will require implementing the access to TPM 2.0 NVRAM, sealing and unsealing the secret data, and generating TOTP. Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 2.0 with legacy boot mode Phase 3 - Qubes OS AEM AMD support: Rebase and refresh TrenchBoot GRUB2 for QubesOS Some work to implement TrenchBoot support for Qubes OS on AMD hardware has been done. GRUB2 with TrenchBoot support has been added to Qubes building system on 3mdeb fork The task aims to refresh the work and align with the upstream Qubes OS GRUB2 repository Clean up the Secure Kernel Loader (formerly LandingZone) package support for QubesOS Since the initial work done by 3mdeb engineers for AMD AEM in Qubes OS, a lot of time has passed, and Secure Kernel Loader - SKL (formerly Landing Zone) has improved a lot and added new features.

For example, one server CPU package may contain two independent CPUs inside called nodes. Each node will enable protection on the SKL during DRTM execution, and this protection must be disabled on each node when TrenchBoot DRTM tasks are done. The task implements the correct support for server CPUs in TrenchBoot SKL. Test the solution on AMD hardware with TPM 2.0 and TPM 1.2 with legacy boot mode Phase 4 - Xen UEFI boot mode with DRTM: TrenchBoot support for UEFI boot mode for AMD in GRUB While TrenchBoot DRTM was extensively tested on Intel hardware with UEFI firmware and Linux, it was not on AMD platforms. This task ensures that DRTM works with UEFI boot mode on AMD processors in GRUB2 and Linux without UEFI Boot Services. TrenchBoot support for UEFI boot mode in Xen When UEFI boot mode with TrenchBoot is working with GRUB2 and Linux, all that is missing to fully support AMD and Intel hardware with Qubes OS AEM is the Xen support to boot in UEFI mode without Boot Services. This requires a significant amount of work to ensure that all information that Xen would obtain from UEFI Boot Services would still be available. The information has to be passed by GRUB2 to Xen via Multiboot2 protocol: EFI memory map Framebuffer information PCI devices information with their option ROMs Additionally \"EFI boot services not terminated\" Multiboot2 tag must not be passed to Xen by GRUB2 on DRTM launch when GRUB2 will terminate Boot Services. Xen should detect such situations and act according to the state of Boot Services. Xen will be implemented to: parse the EFI memory map, framebuffer information, and PCI devices information passed by GRUB2 do not expose the \"EFI boot services\" Multiboot2 tag indicating that Xen can be executed without UEFI Boot Services presence allocate the memory space for the trampoline used to launch other processors or use the allocation done by GRUB2 if necessary do not go error path when Boot Services are not present and skip all calls to UEFI Boot Services by using the information provided by GRUB2 Test the solution on AMD and Intel hardware with TPM 2.0 and TPM 1.2 with legacy and UEFI boot mode Projects or organizations relevant to this project before?

However, being up to date does not prevent the firmware vulnerabilities from appearing. The Static Root of Trust (SRT) like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot and measured boot provided by the firmware is not always sufficient to establish a secure environment for an operating system. If the firmware is compromised, it could inject malicious software into operating system components and prevent the machine owner from detecting it. Silicon vendors implement alternative technologies to establish a Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) to provide a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. Either from SRT or DRT, these integrity measurements can be used for operating system attestation. However, DRT technologies are designed to provide the ability to establish a secure environment for integrity measurements at any arbitrary point of time instead of relying on the firmware, which requires machine reset to establish the aforementioned secure environment. The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs . DRTM hasn't found its place in open-source projects yet, but that gradually changes. The demand on having firmware independent Roots of Trust is increasing, and projects that satisfy this demand are growing, for instance, TrenchBoot . TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to build security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their systems. The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs) that establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of confidence that integrity actions were not subverted is derived. The project has grown a lot thanks to the previous NLnet NGI0 PET grant and now it looks for further expansion into extensive use of the DRT technologies in open-source and security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS . Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid (AEM) software heavily depends on the availability of the DRTM technologies to prevent the Evil Maid attacks . However, the project hasn't evolved much since the beginning of 2018 and froze on the support of TPM 1.2 with Intel TXT in legacy boot mode (BIOS). Because of that, the usage of this security software is effectively limited to older Intel machines only. TPM 1.2 implemented SHA1 hashing algorithm, which is nowadays considered weak in the era of forever-increasing computer performance and quantum computing. The solution to this problem comes with a newer TPM 2.0 with more agile cryptographic algorithms and SHA256 implementation by default. Qubes OS AEM software suffers from the following: Lack of TPM 2.0 support to handle more secure hashes and safer design of the TPM firmware according to a newer specification. Lack of UEFI mode support. All modern systems boot in UEFI mode only. Legacy boot modes are being deprecated and dropped from the PC firmware. The AEM usage is not possible on most if not all modern machines. Qubes OS AEM has never supported AMD processors with AMD Secure Startup technology. Implementing AMD support would make a significant impact and broaden the usage of DRTM technologies. The initial AEM implementation relied on the Trusted Boot , Intel's reference implementation of Intel TXT. It never had any plans to support AMD processors. TrenchBoot is filling this gap, supporting both Intel and AMD hardware which makes it an ideal target to replace Trusted Boot in Qubes OS AEM implementation. Furthermore, the project grant would be used to implement the missing pieces in the Qubes OS AEM software to cover the AMD and Intel support for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem/#compare-your-own-project-with-existing-or-historical-efforts","text":"3mdeb is a licensed provider for quality coreboot consulting services since 2016.

Among them, the Anti Evil Maid was frequently presented by 3mdeb engineers: Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform Anti Evil Maid for modern AMD UEFI-based platform A similar approach was already tried by Assured Information Security (AIS) to boot Xen in UEFI mode with Intel TXT DRTM technology . However, this is only a tiny portion of the work covered by our proposal. Additionally, Qubes OS does not launch using Xen.efi like in the AIS work but uses Multiboot2 protocol with GRUB2 instead, making this approach unusable. Moreover, the Xen.efi approach is much more complex and assumes usage of Trusted Boot, limiting the feature to Intel hardware only.","title":"Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem/#what-are-the-significant-technical-challenges-you-expect-to-solve","text":"First of all, Qubes OS AEM software consists of software packages providing Trusted Boot and the Qubes OS TPM scripts . These software packages would need to replace the Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot supported GRUB2 and Xen. Secondly, the TPM scripts require adding support for TPM 2.0 equivalent functionality. AEM requires access to non-volatile RAM inside TPM, which is defined differently in the TPM 2.0 specification compared to TPM 1.2. Another challenge would be to make Xen possible to boot in UEFI boot mode without Boot Services defined in UEFI specification. Boot Services are a set of functions exposed in UEFI structures that are used to help with handling the boot process. However, the main principle of DRTM technologies is to not depend on any external code that is not a part of the operating system software to be executed after DRTM. UEFI Boot Services are a part of the firmware of which DRTM tries to be independent. The whole security concept of DRTM depends on cutting the ties with firmware. Thus the work includes implementing the capability in Xen not to use the UEFI Boot Services, which GRUB2 would terminate before DRTM is executed. Xen also contains an option not to use the UEFI Runtime Services. Runtime Services is a set of functions available throughout the whole machine lifetime, which means some firmware functionalities are available even when the operating system is launched. Removing the Boot Services from Xen brings certain drawbacks to the system because the Boot Services hold essential information like memory map, TPM event log, graphics framebuffer, etc. This information must be extracted by GRUB before Boot Services are terminated and passed to the Xen. The proposed solution is to pass this information via the Multiboot2 tags defined in the specification for this particular Boot Services information. Another challenge would be to get the work merged in the upstream repositories. It would ensure the long-term support and maintenance of the solution and availability. Providing software packages to be used out of the box is crucial for technology availability.","title":"What are the significant technical challenges you expect to solve"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem/#requested-support","text":"Phase 1: TrenchBoot Intel TXT and TPM 1.2 support Add TPM 1.2 support for Intel TXT in TrenchBoot GRUB2 The TrenchBoot support hasn't been implemented and verified with TPM 1.2 on Intel TXT path. This requirement ensures that the TPM 1.2 is also supported for older Intel hardware with Intel TXT. Xen Secure Launch - Intel TXT support in Xen for TrenchBoot Due to the requirements of Intel TXT and how it is utilized, it is impossible to use the Xen boot protocols defined in the UEFI or Multiboot2 specifications. This task aims to create a custom Intel TXT entry point for Xen, which would hand off to the standard Multiboot2 entry point and enable the direct launch of Xen by GRUB via DRTM on Intel hardware. Additionally, there is no support for launching Xen with Intel TXT other than Trusted Boot. It has to be ported from Trusted Boot specific code: constructing MLE header waking up APs restoring MTRRs reserving the TXT memory reenabling SMIs handling TXT shutdown and S3 resume/suspend TPM event log finding Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2 with legacy boot mode Phase 2 - Qubes OS AEM TPM 2.0 support: Extend the AEM scripts to detect TPM version on the platform As TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 use different software stacks and tools, it is necessary to distinguish the TPM module family and use the appropriate software. The task will implement the logic to distinguish the TPM families. Extend the AEM scripts to use the appropriate software stack for TPM 2.0 While AEM fully supports TPM 1.2, there is no support for TPM 2.0 at all. When the TPM family is determined, the script should use the appropriate software stack for the given TPM. The task implements the AEM TPM 1.2 equivalent functionalities using TPM 2.0 software stack and as a result allowing the use of TPM 2.0 with Qubes OS AEM.

Device power status readout Connect the RTE J1 header to the platform JFP1 header as shown in the picture below: The values \u200b\u200bof R1 , R2 , V1 and V2 should meet the relationship according to the formula R1/R2 = V2/V1 . V1 cannot be greater than 3.3V (RTE property). Complete Setup After preparing all of the connections also three activities should be performed to enable all of the test stand features: Connect Sonoff to the mains: Connect the RTE to the Internet by using the Ethernet cable. Connect the RTE to the mains by using the microUSB 5 V/2 A power supply. Complete setup should looks as follows: Theory of operation The following sections describe how to use all of the enabled features: serial connection to the platform, controlling power supply, enabling basic power actions with the platform (power off/power on/reset), external flashing with the RTE, device power status readout. Serial connection The method of setting and using serial connection is described in the Serial connection guide . Power supply controlling Power supply controlling (in this case: controlling the state of Sonoff) should be performed based on the sonoff.sh script implemented in meta-rte (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform). Note, that before using the above-mentioned script, it should be modified and SONOFF_IP parameter should be set in accordance with obtained Sonoff IP address. To perform basic power operations use the below-described commands: Turn on the power supply: ./sonoff on Turn off the power supply: ./sonoff on Basic power operations Basic power operations should be performed based on the rte_ctrl script implemented in meta-rte (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform). To perform basic power operations use the below-described commands: Turn on the platform: rte_ctrl pon Turn off the platform: rte_ctrl poff Reset the platform: rte_ctrl reset Note, that in order for the above commands to work properly, the platform should be powered up: both Sonoff and the power supply must be turned on. External flashing The external flashing procedure should be performed based on the scripts implemented on the RTE platform. To perform the flashing operation reproduce, the below-described steps: By using scp put the requested Dasharo file to the RTE: scp <path_to_firmware>/<firmware_file> root@<RTE_IP>:/tmp/coreboot.rom Where: path_to_firmware - path to firmware, which should send to RTE, firmware_file - the name of the firmware file, which should be sent to RTE, RTE_IP - IP address of the connected RTE. Login to RTE via ssh or minicom . Read the flash chip by executing the following command on RTE: ./flash.sh read tmp/dump.rom If the reading was successful, the output from the command above should contain the phrase Verifying flash... VERIFIED . Write the flash chip by executing the following command on RTE: ./flash.sh write /tmp/coreboot.rom Do not interrupt the flashing procedure in any way (especially by changing connections). It may cause hardware damage! If the reading was successful, the output from the command above should contain the phrase Verifying flash... VERIFIED .

Try not to tighten all the elements to the maximum, as it will make disassembly difficult. Remember that make all connections in the grounding strap. Device assembly Full set assembly Section below describes the procedure of complete assembling of the working station. Unpack all equipment. Place the motherboard in front of you, this is the component with which most of the operations will be performed. It's best to put something softer under the board so as not to damage it, e.g. during the installation of RAM modules. To install the CPU on the motherboard first, open the CPU socket: Insert the processor carefully and tighten it with the dedicated mechanism: To install the CPU cooler, the parts shown in the picture below are necessary: Attach the black stand to the bottom of the motherboard, then apply and screw down the remaining parts except the cooler itself and apply thermal paste. After these steps, the CPU area should look like this: Then attach the cooler from above by tightening the two screws. Most likely, for this operation, it is necessary to dismantle the fan and restore it after tightening the screws. Install the memory module into the DIMM slots. To insert a single module, open the latch on both sides. Then insert the RAM and gently press the module downward at both ends of the module and the latch will close automatically. Always insert memory modules in the DIMMA2 slot first. Install the M.2 solid-state drive (SSD) into the M.2 slot. Remove the two screws from the cover and the one responsible for disk stabilization. Insert the SSD into the M.2 slot and tighten the previously removed screws. Take the enclosure of the computer and open one side as shown in the picture below: Install the rear panel by inserting it from the inside of the enclosure and pressing it lightly. Insert the motherboard into the case but do not twist it, some pins are hard to connect when the motherboard is screwed. The photo below shows the slots that should be filled in the next steps.

JTPM1 is a 2mm pitch header, you will need 2mm to 2.54mm female-female dupont wires to connect to RTE. Device power status readout Connect the RTE J1 header to the platform JFP1 header as shown in the picture below: The values \u200b\u200bof R1 , R2 , V1 and V2 should meet the relationship according to the formula R1/R2 = V2/V1 . V1 cannot be greater than 3.3V (RTE property). Complete Setup After preparing all of the connections also three activities should be performed to enable all of the test stand features: Connect Sonoff to the mains: Connect the RTE to the Internet by using the Ethernet cable. Connect the RTE to the mains by using the microUSB 5 V/2 A power supply. Complete setup should looks as follows: Theory of operation The following sections describe how to use all of the enabled features: serial connection to the platform, controlling power supply, enabling basic power actions with the platform (power off/power on/reset), external flashing with the RTE, device power status readout. Serial connection The method of setting and using serial connection is described in the Serial connection guide . Power supply controlling Power supply controlling (in this case: controlling the state of Sonoff) should be performed based on the sonoff.sh script implemented in meta-rte (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform). Note, that before using the above-mentioned script, it should be modified and SONOFF_IP parameter should be set in accordance with obtained Sonoff IP address. To perform basic power operations use the below-described commands: Turn on the power supply: ./sonoff on Turn off the power supply: ./sonoff on Basic power operations Basic power operations should be performed based on the rte_ctrl script implemented in meta-rte (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform). To perform basic power operations use the below-described commands: Turn on the platform: rte_ctrl pon Turn off the platform: rte_ctrl poff Reset the platform: rte_ctrl reset Note, that in order for the above commands to work properly, the platform should be powered up: both Sonoff and the power supply must be turned on. External flashing The external flashing procedure should be performed based on the scripts implemented on the RTE platform. To perform the flashing operation reproduce, the below-described steps: By using scp put the requested Dasharo file to the RTE: scp <path_to_firmware>/<firmware_file> root@<RTE_IP>:/tmp/coreboot.rom Where: path_to_firmware - path to firmware, which should send to RTE, firmware_file - the name of the firmware file, which should be sent to RTE, RTE_IP - IP address of the connected RTE. Login to RTE via ssh or minicom . Read the flash chip by executing the following command on RTE: ./flash.sh read tmp/dump.rom If the reading was successful, the output from the command above should contain the phrase Verifying flash... VERIFIED . Write the flash chip by executing the following command on RTE: ./flash.sh write /tmp/coreboot.rom Do not interrupt the flashing procedure in any way (especially by changing connections). It may cause hardware damage! If the reading was successful, the output from the command above should contain the phrase Verifying flash... VERIFIED . Device power status readout To read the current power status use the following command: cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio12/value Example output: 1 means that the platform is turned on. 0 means that the platform is turned off.","title":"Laboratory stand assembly guide"},{"location":"transparent-validation/msi-z790/laboratory-assembly-guide/#laboratory-stand-dedicated-to-msi-pro-z790-p-assembly-guide","text":"","title":"Laboratory stand dedicated to MSI PRO Z790-P assembly guide"},{"location":"transparent-validation/msi-z790/laboratory-assembly-guide/#introduction","text":"This document describes the assembly procedure dedicated to the MSI PRO Z790-P testing stand.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"transparent-validation/msi-z790/laboratory-assembly-guide/#prerequisites","text":"The below table contains information about all elements which are needed to create the testing stand.

Download and extract image - link Flash image into microSD card ( Etcher tool could be helpful) Insert card to NanoPi microSD slot. Attach NanoPi to muxPi connectors. Plug Ethernet cable to RJ45 NanoPi port. Serial communication There are two methods to setup serial communication with muxPi: with microUSB<->USB cable with UART/USB converter Attach USB/UART converter to muxPi's left addon female header ( GND , DBG UART RX , DBG UART TX on pinout image below): and plug USB connector to the computer. Next, open connection in PC terminal by typing: sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -o -b 115200 . /dev/ttyUSB0 is example device - check whether USB0 is the correct one Jumpers configuration UART - pins Vloc & VCC - if jumped then internal voltage generator is used as voltage reference for data lines and powers up target device. If open then voltage reference for data lines comes from target device and internal voltage generator is unused. USB/ETH - determines what USB data lines of one USB HUB are connected to. If first two pins are jumped then USB lines are connected to add-on connector. If last two pins are jumped then these lines are connected tu USB<->ETH converter. If none of the pins are jumped then the only connection is the upper socket of double connector. NOTE: The upper socket of double USB-A connector must be left empty if USB<->ETH is selected or add-on connector is selected and something is connected to these data lines on the addon! NOTE: Both jumpers must be placed in the same position! VDD - if this pins are jumped then the VDD and 3V3 are always on. If this is left open then VDD and 3V3 are controlled by NanoPi. The usage example is setting value of USB ID potentiometer (which is located underneath NanoPi). But when NanoPi NEO is removed there is no way to turn on power for microcontroller (that is when VDD jumper is helpful). NOTE: If there is no particular need then leave this jumper open. Power supply To power on MuxPi with NanoPi attached, plug the 5V/2A DC 5.5/2.1mm power supply jack to the CON1 muxPi's connector. Power consumption of MuxPi should be less then 1A assuming no addons connected. IP address To check which IP address has been assigned, type in terminal: ifconfig . OPTIONAL STEP: To set static IP, create the following file: sudo vi /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf Edit NetworkManger.conf and set the value of \"managed\" under \"ifupdown\" to false: [ ifupdown ] managed = false Add network setting to /etc/network/interfaces : sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces Here is sample of /etc/network/interfaces : # The loopback network interface auto lo iface lo inet loopback # network interface not managed by Network Manager allow-hotplug eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 192 .168.4.XXX netmask 255 .255.255.0 gateway 192 .168.4.1 dns-nameservers 192 .168.4.1 Restart the whole device: reboot Now you should be able to connect to device through ssh: ssh root@192.168.4.XXX with the password: fa Install WiringNP Connect to NanoPi NEO through ssh (serial connection automatically login to non root user pi ), then type: git clone https://github.com/friendlyarm/WiringNP cd WiringNP/ chmod 755 build ./build Verify installation: gpio readall If your installation is successful the following messages will show up: +-----+-----+----------+------+---+-NanoPi-NEO--+------+----------+-----+-----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Physical | V | Mode | Name | wPi | BCM | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----++----+---+------+----------+-----+-----+ | | | 3 .3V | | | 1 || 2 | | | 5V | | | | 12 | 8 | GPIOA12 | ALT5 | 0 | 3 || 4 | | | 5V | | | | 11 | 9 | GPIOA11 | ALT5 | 0 | 5 || 6 | | | 0v | | | | 203 | 7 | GPIOG11 | OFF | 0 | 7 || 8 | 0 | ALT5 | GPIOG6 | 15 | 198 | | | | 0v | | | 9 || 10 | 0 | ALT5 | GPIOG7 | 16 | 199 | | 0 | 0 | GPIOA0 | ALT5 | 0 | 11 || 12 | 0 | OUT | GPIOA6 | 1 | 6 | | 2 | 2 | GPIOA2 | OFF | 0 | 13 || 14 | | | 0v | | | | 3 | 3 | GPIOA3 | OFF | 0 | 15 || 16 | 0 | OFF | GPIOG8 | 4 | 200 | | | | 3 .3v | | | 17 || 18 | 0 | OFF | GPIOG9 | 5 | 201 | | 64 | 12 | GPIOC0 | ALT4 | 0 | 19 || 20 | | | 0v | | | | 65 | 13 | GPIOC1 | ALT4 | 0 | 21 || 22 | 0 | ALT5 | GPIOA1 | 6 | 1 | | 66 | 14 | GPIOC2 | ALT4 | 0 | 23 || 24 | 1 | OUT | GPIOC3 | 10 | 67 | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----++----+---+------+----------+-----+-----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Physical | V | Mode | Name | wPi | BCM | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+-NanoPi-NEO--+------+----------+-----+-----+ +-----+----NanoPi-NEO USB/Audio-+----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Ph | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ | | | 5V | | | 25 | | | | USB-DP1 | | | 26 | | | | USB-DM1 | | | 27 | | | | USB-DP2 | | | 28 | | | | USB-DM2 | | | 29 | | | | IR-RX | | | 30 | | 17 | 19 | GPIOA17 | OFF | 0 | 31 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 32 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 33 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 34 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 35 | | | | 0V | | | 36 | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ +-----+----NanoPi-NEO Debug UART-+----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Ph | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ | 4 | 17 | GPIOA4 | ALT5 | 0 | 37 | | 5 | 18 | GPIOA5 | ALT5 | 0 | 38 | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ Cortex-M0 flashing The second controllable unit on the muxPi board is embedded microcontroller STM32 F030C6T6 from Cortex-M0 family. It is required to flash special binary prepared by Tizen group (the code is not open yet, but this process is in progress). To flash muxPi's microcontroller, follow steps below: Make sure that VDD jumper is left open. Download binary file - link Copy binary to nanoPi: scp <path-to-file> root@192.168.4.XXX:/root/ Update package lists (nanoPi): apt-get update Install stm32flash utility (nanoPi): sudo apt-get install stm32flash Export GPIO: gpio mode 3 out and gpio mode 7 out Set Cortex-M0 to \"Flashing mode\": gpio write 7 1 Power up microcontroller: gpio write 3 1 Flash firmware: stm32flash -w firmware-05.bin -v -g 0x0 /dev/ttyS2 Power off microcontroller: gpio write 3 0 Set Cortex-M0 to \"Execution mode\": gpio write 7 0 Power on microcontroller: gpio write 3 1 From now on, muxPi's LCD should light on and display: * MuxPi * HW: 1 .0 SW: 0 .5 Software installation NOTE: It is recommended to cross-compile muxPi's software on your host machine Building using docker Prerequisites: Docker , Make . Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/SamsungSLAV/muxpi.git . Change directory: cd muxpi/sw/nanopi . Build muxPi software: make docker-build Resulting binaries will be in bin directory.

Copy fota binary to MuxPi device (change XXX to proper values): scp bin/fota_armv7 root@192.168.4.XXX:/usr/bin/fota On your MuxPi device - create a symlink from /usr/local/bin/fota to /usr/bin/fota/ . Only /usr/local/bin/fota/ should be used by software interfacing with MuxPi. This allows to swap fota implementation to your preferred tool: ln -s /usr/bin/fota /usr/local/bin/fota DUT setup DUT power supply MuxPi is capable of: power switching on/off current measurement Power switching - it can switch power supply up to 5A and 250VAC. One line is connected directly and one is connected through relay. Current measurement - It is able to measure up to -/+5A and is galvanically isolated from the rest of components thanks to use of Hall effect current sensor ACS712ELCTR-05B-T. It is connected to unswitchable power line. The current sensor is bypassed with 3 0R resistors that can be populated if current sensor is not needed. These resistors must not be populated if current measurement is required. UART connections GND - digital ground of MuxPi board N.C. - not connected Vloc - local voltage - voltage may be generated internally on MuxPi if the DUT, or anything else we are connecting to, has not power pin. Nn such case voltage generator must be set to desired value and activated. Command \"uart 3300\" must be sent to Cortex-M0, where 3300 is desired voltage given in millivolts. The voltage range is from 0 to 5000mv. Pins Vloc an VCC must be connected each other. Typical jumper is a perfect connector for this purpose. Vloc may be also used to power up additional converter RS232C. For example if converter to RS232C (+/-12v) must be used then it may be powered from Vloc pin. VCC - power of DUT. If dut has no such power pin then it must be connected to Vloc and vloc must be configured properly as stated above. DUT RX - receiver data line in the DUT - through this line MuxPi sends data to the DUT DUT TX - transmitter data line in the DUT - from this line MuxPi reads data form the DUT DUT CTS - Clear To Send - hardware handshake DUT RTS - Ready To Send - hardware handshake Example configuration for OrangePi (DUT) uart connection: Set 3.3V Vloc (/dev/ttyS2 terminal): uart 3300 Attach UART jumper ( Vloc and Vcc ). Connect GND, RX and TX (without crossing). Open connection: screen /dev/ttyS1 115200,cs8,ixon,ixoff NOTE: RX , TX , XTS , RTS are crossed on the board so you don't need to cross the wires by yourself. NOTE: A device powered from Vloc mustn't draw more than 50mA of current. Add-ons Add-ons headers are extensions for attaching new shields or simply using NanoPi and CortexM0 interfaces: 5V - power supply - not switchable - always present 3V3 - switchable (controlled by NanoPi) 3.3V power supply I2C0 SDA - I2C0 SDA line connected to NanoPi I2C0 SCL - I2C0 SCL line connected to NanoPi DBG UART TX - UART0 (debug) of NanoPi DBG UART RX - UART0 (debug) of NanoPi USB B+/- , USB A+/- USB host lines connected to NanoPi through USB HUB GND - ground lines N.C . - not connected SPI0 CLK - SPI0 clock line connected to NanoPi SPI0 MOSI - SPI0 \"master output slave input\" line connected to NanoPi SPI0 CS - SPI0 \"chip select\" line connected to NanoPi SPI0 MISO - SPI0 \"master input slave output\" line connected to NanoPi PI GPIO 1,2,3 - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) connected to NanoPi NEO. Ports PG11, PL11, PA17 respectively. ST GPIO 1,2,3 - GPIO connected to Cortex-M0 microcontroller. Ports PB3, PB4, PB5 of STM32F03C6T6 respectively. ADC1,2 - analog inputs connected to analog to digital converter of Cortex-M0 microcontroller. Ports PA1, PA2 respectively. Voltage range of this input is 0 to 3.3V. This lines are not buffered in any way so attention must paid when dealing with them. GND - ground lines NOTE: PI GPIO 1 has additional special function. It is connected to Cortex-M0 Boot0 pin which enables firmware download mode during microcontroller boot. 1 - enables this mode while 0 disables it. So it is useless as GPIO when the microcontroller is being booted. DyPers Dyper is a small, electromagnetic relay which is controllable by software. There are 2 dypers on MuxPi board. Each of them has two channels. Both channels are switched at the same time with the same command. So both of them can be on and both can be off but there is no way to turn one on and one off. They can be controlled by CortexM0 - examples here . ETH and USB ETH and upper USB of double USB socket share the same USB channel from USB HUB. Jumpers located at the rear side of double USB connector allow to disconnect this USB from ETH and connect to add-on connector. Details on this topic are covered in jumpers section. USB-M This is USB connector dedicated to mobile devices from Samsung company. This connector has controllable Vbus line and also controllable ID line. More information about this type of interface, it's capabilities and example of flashing smartphone can be found here . SD Adapter This connector is used to connect microSD card, put into MuxPi, to a DUT. This connector requires IDC-uSD cable adapter: Target microSD card must be attached to microSD card reader accessible on bottom side of muxPi board. To enable microSD card reader, connect to Cortex from MuxPi via minicom: minicom -D /dev/ttyS2 and enter in minicom following commands: ts and then: dut Each command should return OK After doing this you can connect the uSD's end of the cable adapter to the external card reader and check if it is correctly recognized by PC. You should also be able to run the microcontroller from the card attached to MuxPi if the card contains appropriate OS. Interacting with muxPi Connection with NanoPi User can simply open SSH connection by (password: fa ): ssh root@<muxpi-ip-address> or use serial connection mentioned here NOTE: Connecting with MuxPi through serial will automatically login as non root user pi with password pi .

The microcontroller is connected to NanoPi NEO with UART. This UART is connected to third UART of NanoPi - /dev/ttyS2. The port is configured to 115200,8,N1 and cannot be changed without modification of the firmware. The protocol is text based, simple and human readable. Each command has to be ended with 'n' or 'r' character. Each command is confirmed with 'OK' string or error string.

Requirements Note that the PiKVM build might be basing on two types of Raspberry Pi: RPi 4 or RPi Zero 2W. Hardware components necessary to build PiKVM on RPi Zero 2W: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, microSD card 16 GB, USB-A 5 V 3.1 A charger (female socket), HDMI to CSI-2 bridge, Raspberry Pi Zero Camera Cable, HDMI-HDMI cable, USB A - micro USB cable (male, male), Y-splitter cable. (Optional) UART -> USB converter Hardware components necessary to build PiKVM on RPi 4: Raspberry Pi 4, microSD card 16 GB, USB-A 5 V 3.1 A charger (female socket), HDMI to CSI-2 bridge, HDMI-HDMI cable, USB A - USB C cable, Y-splitter cable. (Optional) UART -> USB converter Device assembly The following section of the documentation shows the assembly procedure for PiKVM including setting up a WiFi connection and methods for reading device IP. Set based on RPi Zero 2W preparation The section below describes the method of preparing PiKVM hardware based on RPI Zero 2W. Connect SD card and HDMI to CSI-2 bridge with camera cable: Block USB power from device under test by preparing USB cable: Connect HDMI cable from the device under test to HDMI -> CSI-2 bridge. Connect the USB splitter to the Raspberry Pi micro USB port. Connect one side of the splitter to USB-A 5 V 3.1 A charger. Connect other side to device under test via USB cable with blocked power. Set based on RPi 4 preparation To build PiKVM on RPi 4, use the RPI 0 set documentation and replace the cable for connecting to the RPi and the cable for connecting with the CSI-2 bridge. OS image building and flashing Prepare the OS in accordance with the PiKVM Handbook . Flash the SD card using bmaptool or balenaEtcher . to do this by balenaEtcher go to the producer site and follow his procedure on how to download and flash an SD card. to do this by bmaptool reproduce the following steps: install bmaptool by opening the terminal and typing the following command: sudo apt install bmap-tools create the bmap by typing the following command: bmaptool create /path/to/your/image > /path/where/you/want/bmap/file/saved/bmapfilename.bmap flash image to the SD card by typing the following command: sudo bmaptool copy --bmap ~/path/where/your/bmap/file/is/located /path/where/your/image/is/located /path/to/memory/device Insert the flashed SD card into the SD card slot on the PiKVM. Set up WiFi The section below describes the method of setting up a WiFi connection for the PiKVM. This section is dedicated especially to the PiKVMs based on RPi Zero 2W, which is not equipped with an Ethernet port. Mount the first partition of the memory card. Edit or make the pikvm.txt file in the following convention: FIRSTBOOT = 1 WIFI_ESSID = \"name\" WIFI_PASSWD = \"password\" Note: Do not remove line FIRSTBOOT=1 or FIRST_BOOT-1 line. It may occur with troubles with the device starts. Unmount the first partition of the memory card. Note: In some countries, in which WiFi channel 13 is in use, the device might not connect to the WiFi. To prevent this, the router should be configured properly: channels 12-14 or Auto Scan mode should be disabled. Read IP address The section below describes the known methods of reading PiKVM IP. First option: from os repository run the following command: make scan Example output: . . . ===== Toolbox image is ready ===== ===== Searching for Pis in the local network ===== docker run \\ --rm \\ --tty \\ --net host \\ pi-builder-arm-toolbox arp-scan --localnet | grep -Pi \"\\s(b8:27:eb:|dc:a6:32:)\" || true 192 .168.4.13 dc:a6:32:aa:aa:aa Raspberry Pi Trading Ltd Second option: open the web interface of your router and find the list of issued IP addresses. Localization of the mentioned list depends on the router model. Third option: solder pins for serial output as on images below: Check Raspberry Pi Zero2W IP by booting to system and reading information via serial (eg.) UART -> USB converter. Device validation Connect the device to the mains. Login to RTE via ssh (by using earlier obtained IP address) or minicom (by using USB-UART converter with 3 wire cables). FullHD stream In order to enable FullHD stream (1920x1080) instead of 1200x720. One of the reasons to enable FullHD is that certain proprietary BIOSes implement a GUI setup which scales well only for Full HD or higher resolutions (in extreme cases it can even crash if lower than FullHD resolution is used). To enable FullHD resolution, one has to replace the EDID on PiKVM. To do so: Remount the filesystem to RW if necessary using rw command. Save the follow HEX to /root/edid.hex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xecute: kvmd-edidconf --edid=/root/edid.hex --apply Execute: kvmd-edidconf --import=/root/edid.hex Switch the filesystem back to RO using ro command.

Using Supermicro Update Manager (SUM) Supermicro Update Manager is a proprietary tool for interacting with Supermicro BMC. It can be used to change BIOS settings or mount virtual drive through CLI, among other things. Examples below assume that SUM was downloaded and extracted, and commands are executed from directory with sum executable. Mounting floppy image ./sum -i [ bmc_ip ] -u [ bmc_username ] -p [ bmc_password ] -c MountFloppyImage --file path/to/file.img Mounting ISO image Contrary to mounting floppy, for ISO you have to pass URL instead of path to local file. SUM supports SAMBA, HTTP and, in latest versions, HTTPS. ./sum -i [ bmc_ip ] -u [ bmc_username ] -p [ bmc_password ] -c MountIsoImage --image_url http://www.example.com/cd.iso Reading default and current BIOS configuration To read out default settings: ./sum -i [ bmc_ip ] -u [ bmc_username ] -p [ bmc_password ] -c GetDefaultBiosCfg --file bios.cfg To get current settings instead, change GetDefaultBiosCfg to GetCurrentBiosCfg . In both cases, you can omit --file bios.cfg to print the settings to standard output. Writing settings to BIOS ./sum -i [ bmc_ip ] -u [ bmc_username ] -p [ bmc_password ] -c ChangeBiosCfg --file bios.cfg There are additional switches to this command like --reboot and --post_complete , but they require cooperation from the running OS. These commands result in OS displaying power off (or log out) window, as if power button was pressed. After 5 minutes or so a hard reboot is initiated. This gives user a chance to save current work, but for test automation this may be unnecessary delay.

Please read this extensive analysis contributed to Intel Reddit. Why do you use the nomenclature MSI Z690-A (WIFI) (DDR4) ? This nomenclature is the result of the naming used by the producer. MSI PRO Z690-A is the nomenclature used for naming the platform with DDR5 memory slots. If the platform is also equipped with the WiFi module, its naming nomenclature will additionally include the phrase WIFI . If instead of DDR5 memory slots, the platform is equipped with DDR4 memory slots, its naming nomenclature will additionally include the phrase DDR4 . Will this work on my MSI PRO Z690-A (model with DDR5 support)? Yes, during test procedures the Dasharo firmware work has been confirmed for the DDR5 platform without WIFI. Dasharo working correctness has not been tested on MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI . However, given that the difference is only the WiFi module, there should be no problems using Dasharo on it as well. Will this work on my MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 ? Yes, during test procedures the Dasharo firmware work has been confirmed for the DDR4 WIFI platform. In turn, Dasharo working correctness on MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 has been confirmed by the community. Can I safely try this on my board? If you are afraid of bricking the board and have no means of recovering from failed installation , we do not recommend trying it out until at least the v1.0.0 is released. Recovery process is not suitable for inexperienced users right now. We will be trying to make it easier, and if that happens, we may change our recommendation here. Can I destroy my hardware by installing this firmware? We give no warranty, although it is highly unlikely, provided that you use the supported board model and follow the Initial Deployment . In the worst scenario, you might \"brick\" the board, rendering it unbootable. It can be fixed by following the recovery procedure . In case of concerns, we invite you to buy the equipment directly in our online store with a subscription service, under which we perform the Dasharo installation with the latest release, and offer full support through invite-only Matrix channel. How can I know if the board is \"bricked\"? In such a case, you would get stuck with black screen on the display. There will be no beeping sounds from the buzzer as well. The only way to get some information on what's going on in that state is to use the Serial header to read out error information. What can be the reason of board \"bricking\"? The most common reason would be the fact that you DDR memory modules are not initialized properly. The other reason might be improper or interrupted installation. Please make sure to follow the Initial Deployment Manual correctly. How can I \"unbrick\" my board? Please follow the recovery procedure . Which CPUs are supported? We can say the \"supported\" one is the one that have been tested during Validation Procedure or have been tested by the community. The list of all supported CPUs is available in the CPU HCL documentation. In practice, any Alder Lake-S Processor should work. 12900KS is rather unknown at the moment, because it was released later and may require more recent microcode. Which memory modules are supported? We can say the \"supported\" one is the one that have been tested during Validation Procedure or have been tested by the community. The list of all supported memory modules is available in the Memory HCL documentation. What is the memory profile? Currently, Dasharo firmware picks the highest standard SPD Profile, no support for XMP ones. This means that on the Kingston modules it is actually working at 2400 MHz, but it is expected to work all the way to 3200 MHz. Why my GPU doesn't work on MSI PRO Z690-A (DDR4) (WIFI) ? Due to the fact, that there's no possibility to insert all available GPU drivers into the firmware, the solution in the form of the Option ROM is in use. Option ROMs are the drivers flashed in the GPUs non-volatile memory. These types of drivers can be divided into Legacy Option ROMs and EFI Option ROMs . Legacy Option ROMs are only supported on legacy BIOS, such as SeaBIOS. Legacy BIOS checks the availability of Option ROM and if its signature matches, it executes its entry point. This option ROM initializes the graphics. The only way to support Option ROM in UEFI is through CSM, which we do not have implemented. EFI Option ROMs are nothing more than EFI drivers which have the same form as the UEFI files (PE format). UEFI firmware scans the Option ROM space of the graphics card and if it finds a potential EFI Option ROM with PE signature, it executes the file. This option ROM initializes the graphics. Considering the above, the firmware might have a problem with initializing older graphics cards - UEFI standard appeared about 15 years ago. The problem might also be caused by an enabled Secure boot - because there is no certainty that EFI Option ROM is signed correctly. Which GPUs are supported? We can say the \"supported\" one is the one that have been tested during Validation Procedure or have been tested by the community. The list of all supported memory modules is available in the GPU HCL documentation. What does the obligatory Dasharo Subscripion includes? The Dasharo Subscription includes: The latest Dasharo Entry Subscription release installed by Dasharo Team Dasharo Updates \u2013 number of updates depends on the number of Dasharo Subscriptions sold and the availability of other funding (e.g., NLNet, corporate sponsors, community donations ) Priority support for Dasharo Subscribers through invite-only Matrix channel Influence on Dasharo features roadmap \u2013 you can have a real impact on Dasharo development by direct access with the developers or premium voting on github. You will gain the access to the dedicated channels on the matrix communicator.

Full question: \"In the Disclaimer, you wrote that one of the warranty conditions is: \"No signs of customer interference with the platform or firmware.\" How would a user modify firmware without losing the warranty? Being open source to be easy to modify, then saying \"don't touch this\" seems contradictory. How would you add an exception?\" Playing with firmware parameters can result in damaging the mainboard.

The update process may be different, depending on which firmware version is currently installed on your device. The currently installed firmware version can be checked with the following command in a Linux environment: sudo dmidecode -t bios | grep Version Alternatively, it can be checked in the BIOS Setup Menu . Prerequisites Before proceeding, ensure that the firmware protections are disabled in Dasharo Security Options . Both BIOS boot medium lock and Enable SMM BIOS write protection should be unchecked. UEFI Secure Boot must be disabled as well (uncheck Attempt Secure Boot if Current Secure Boot State does not say Disabled ). To apply changes you will need to reboot. Please use one of the following environments to perform Dasharo update: Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS) Linux distribution of your choice We recommend using the DTS. Dasharo Tools Suite The DTS allows performing automatic firmware update process, which is the recommended method. To update your firmware, follow below steps. Boot DTS using iPXE on your platform. Follow firmware update procedure described in DTS documentation. Linux distribution of your choice Linux distributions may not yet have the support for the newest chipsets in flashrom installed via package manager so building the flashrom from source may be inevitable. You may check if your flashrom supports the Z690 and Z790 chipset by doing a dry run without firmware binary: sudo flashrom -p internal Example output of undetected chipset: flashrom v1.2 on Linux 5.19.0-32-generic (x86_64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). Cannot open file stream for /dev/mtd0 No DMI table found. WARNING: No chipset found. Flash detection will most likely fail. ======================================================================== You may be running flashrom on an unknown laptop. We could not detect this for sure because your vendor has not set up the SMBIOS tables correctly. Some internal buses have been disabled for safety reasons. You can enforce using all buses by adding -p internal:laptop=this_is_not_a_laptop to the command line, but please read the following warning if you are not sure. Laptops, notebooks and netbooks are difficult to support and we recommend to use the vendor flashing utility. The embedded controller (EC) in these machines often interacts badly with flashing. See the manpage and https://flashrom.org/Laptops for details. If flash is shared with the EC, erase is guaranteed to brick your laptop and write may brick your laptop. Read and probe may irritate your EC and cause fan failure, backlight failure and sudden poweroff. You have been warned. ======================================================================== No EEPROM/flash device found. Note: flashrom can never write if the flash chip isn't found automatically. It means you cannot proceed with this flashrom version and you have to remove it using your package manager. Then follow the procedure for building the right flashrom is described in Build flashrom section in the Initial deployment documentation (note the procedure describes Ubuntu case only, your package manager and package names to install may be slightly different). We recommend to use Dasharo Tools Suite . Example of good output: flashrom v1.2-1031-g6b2061b on Linux 5.19.0-32-generic (x86_64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). No DMI table found. Found chipset \"Intel Z690\". Enabling flash write... SPI Configuration is locked down. FREG0: Flash Descriptor region (0x00000000-0x00000fff) is read-write. FREG1: BIOS region (0x01000000-0x01ffffff) is read-write. FREG2: Management Engine region (0x00001000-0x003d8fff) is read-write. Enabling hardware sequencing because some important opcode is locked. OK. Found Programmer flash chip \"Opaque flash chip\" (32768 kB, Programmer-specific) on internal. No operations were specified. That means you are good to go. Migrating SMBIOS unique data (optional) Before flashing you may migrate your serial number and UUID as described in Initial deployment . Applicable to Dasharo v1.1.0 (PRO Z690-A) / v0.9.0 (PRO Z790-P) and later. Flashing using flashrom PRO Z690-A boards PRO Z790-P boards Version v1.1.0 or newer Version v1.1.0 and v1.1.2 had to change the flashmap layout and requires usage of the procedure below when migrating from v1.0.0 or older. Only the RW_SECTION_A and RW_SECTION_B partitions of the flash needs to be updated. Flash it using the following command: flashrom -p internal -w [ path ] --fmap -i RW_SECTION_A -i RW_SECTION_B To flash newer firmware the command described in the section below might be also used. But remember, in that case, all Dasharo UEFI settings will be lost. Also, the memory training procedure will have to be carried out again. Version older than v1.1.0 In this case, the whole bios region must be updated. flashrom -p internal -w [ path ] --ifd -i bios There is only one version available for now.

Memory Modules are tested in 1, 2 and 4 modules configurations. These follow the DIMM population procedures as stated in the Board Manual: 1 module in DIMMA2 Slot (Single Channel), 2 by adding another module in DIMMB2 (Dual Channel), and 4 by populating all 4 slots. Testing is defined as passing firmware POST and booting an OS, since what is being tested is that the Intel FSP (Firmware Support Package) component is initializing the Memory Modules. We don't stress test them for stability. Each SPD Profile is tested, so each Memory Module can have from 1 to 4 entries. You may also check out Intel memory validation results page and see the results for DDR4 UDIMM testing. Maximum ratings for Alder Lake S CPUs is also available in the CPU datasheet . Legend: Configuration 1/2/4 - means given memory module was tested in 1, 2 and 4 DIMMs populated configuration, \u2714 means successfully tested, \u2716 means platform did not boot with Dasharo, e.g. \u2714/\u2714/\u2714 means all configurations work, - means not tested Size: DIMM capacity in MB SPD profile: can be one of JEDEC(Standard) / XMP Profile #1 / XMP Profile #2. Profile data: Type/speed: for example DDR4-2400 means DDR4 module clocked at max 2400MHz for given profile Timings: for example CL17-17-17 means CAS Latency 17, tRCD 17, tRP 17 (numbers expressed in clock cycles) for given memory profile Voltage: memory voltage in Volts for given memory profile NOTE: some XMP profiles may have lower speeds than other ones, but also have smaller CAS latency. Also the memory frequency configured in the memory controller and reported by DMI/SMBIOS may be slightly lower than advertised in the module specifications. This can vary based on the board design, CPU and many other factors.

The binaries can be found on the MSI PRO Z690-A release page MSI PRO Z790-P release page . Reading flash contents Always prepare a backup of the current firmware image. To read the original firmware from the flash and save it to a file ( dump.rom ), execute the following command: sudo flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom IMPORTANT! You will need a second USB storage to keep the dumped firmware backup or alternatively upload it to some cloud or network drive (Ubuntu live has a Firefox browser installed). Ubuntu live image is volatile and has no persistent storage. All changes made in the live image will be lost after reboot. Migrating SMBIOS unique data To migrate the SMBIOS system UUID and board serial number follow the Linux instructions below before attempting to flash the binary. The procedure is supported on Dasharo version v1.0.0 and later and requires cbfstool built from coreboot tree. Follow the Building Manual using the Z690-A v1.0.0/Z790-P v0.9.0 version or newer and then: echo -n ` sudo dmidecode -s system-uuid ` > system_uuid.txt echo -n ` sudo dmidecode -s baseboard-serial-number ` > serial_number.txt #

Please check Vboot documentation how to resign the data. It is the machine owner's responsibility to generate and use own keys during updates. Flashing Dasharo WARNING : If you use an external/discrete GPU and migrate to Dasharo, be sure to unplug the dGPU first (when the machine is powered off before proceeding with flashing), as Dasharo firmware does not support all GPU cards properly yet (as of version v1.0.0). There is a high risk for the graphical output to break in the firmware when dGPU is connected. Effectively it leaves the only option to boot in blind into a previously installed OS (if the platform does not brick and if an OS is present on a disk). The first boot may take up to 2 minutes to fully train the memory, so be patient and wait for the Dasharo logo to appear, subsequent boots will take only seconds. MSI EZ debug leds are not supported by Dasharo and you may notice a red led to be lit. If the platform boots with an integrated GPU, you may try to plug the external GPU back and boot again. To flash Dasharo on the platform, execute the following command: PRO Z690-A (WIFI) DDR4 PRO Z690-A (WIFI) PRO Z790-P (WIFI) DDR4 PRO Z790-P (WIFI) Replace the VERSION in firmware file name with the version you want to flash. For example: msi_ms7d25_v1.1.1_ddr4.rom . sudo flashrom -p internal -w msi_ms7d25_vVERSION_ddr4.rom --ifd -i bios Replace the VERSION in firmware file name with the version you want to flash. For example: msi_ms7d25_v1.1.1_ddr5.rom . sudo flashrom -p internal -w msi_ms7d25_vVERSION_ddr5.rom --ifd -i bios Replace the VERSION in firmware file name with the version you want to flash. For example: msi_ms7e06_v0.9.0_ddr4.rom . sudo flashrom -p internal -w msi_ms7e06_vVERSION_ddr4.rom --ifd -i bios Replace the VERSION in firmware file name with the version you want to flash. For example: msi_ms7e06_v0.9.0_ddr5.rom . sudo flashrom -p internal -w msi_ms7e06_vVERSION_ddr5.rom --ifd -i bios IMPORTANT! After the command succeeds, invoke sudo reboot or click the reboot/restart in the GUI to reboot the board. Press ENTER when prompted on the screen to remove the installation media (if Ubuntu live is used). DO NOT POWEROFF THE BOARD as SMI handlers of original MSI firmware may overwrite flash contents and cause a brick. After migration from MSI firmware to Dasharo and reboot, the firmware will fail the memory training. After reboot wait approximately 30 seconds and then power the board off by holding the power button pushed for 5 seconds. Dasharo v1.1.0 or newer will signal the memory training failure with PC speaker beeps and blinking SATA LED. When it happens use the power button to power the board off (no need to wait 30 seconds in such case). Power on the board back. Now the memory training should not fail and after approximately 1 minute (can be nearly 2 minutes for DDR5 memory), you should get a Dasharo splash screen on the monitor. Subsequent boots will take only a few seconds. Flashing back vendor firmware sudo flashrom -p internal -w dump.rom --ifd -i bios NOTE: Dasharo version v0.1.0 will not have a network connection. Use a different USB storage or a USB to Ethernet/USB WiFi adapter to move the binary to the live system.","title":"Initial deployment"},{"location":"unified/msi/initial-deployment/#initial-deployment","text":"Initial deployment of Dasharo firmware on MSI PRO Z690-A and PRO Z790-P can be done: using DTS, manually.","title":"Initial Deployment"},{"location":"unified/msi/initial-deployment/#initial-deployment-using-dts","text":"To ensure a smooth deployment process, it is recommended to use the latest version of DTS available from the releases page .

On certain hardware configurations, the Dasharo firmware may not boot correctly (i.e. we will have \"bricked\" the platform). In such a case, the recovery procedure can reinstall the original firmware from the board manufacturer. There are two documented recovery methods: using a CH341A programming kit or an RTE . Since Dasharo v1.1.2 (PRO Z690-A) / v0.9.0 (PRO Z790-P) release it is also possible to use MSI FlashBIOS button feature to recover using an image placed in the USB stick. Using MSI FlashBIOS button Format an empty USB drive with FAT32 filesystem. Place Dasharo release binary or official MSI binary on the drive's root directory and name it MSI.ROM . Put the drive in the rear USB 2.0 port marked as FlashBIOS . Be sure that your machine is powered off (ATX supply must be still connected). Press the FlashBIOS button near the FlashBIOS port. After a few seconds the machine should power on the ATX supply and begin flashing (the red diode will be blinking). Wait approximately 5 minutes for the process to finish. The board will automatically restart and boot. Here is a video showing the process . External flashing with programmer RTE In this case, using external programmer is necessary. We are using RTE here. Connect programmer to the flash chip as shown in the Hardware connection / SPI section of the Development documentation. Download official BIOS from vendor's website (this is the newest version, you may choose an older one too or in the best case use your firmware backup): wget https://download.msi.com/bos_exe/mb/7D25v13.zip unzip 7D25v13.zip Flash via external programmer: The command line will be different, depending on the programmer you use flashrom -p linux_spi:dev = /dev/spidev1.0,spispeed = 16000 -w 7D25v13/E7D25IMS.130 First boot after the recovery process is significantly longer CH341A Prerequisites The full set is now available at our online shop . CH341A kit with 1.8V level-shifter. Can be bought on e.g. Amazon WSON8 probe. Can be bought from China on Aliexpress or eBay. USB2.0 Female-Male extension cord 0.5m or longer (optional) Machine with Linux and flashrom. Connection First start with assembling the CH341A and the 1.8V adapter. Pay attention to which holes you attach the adapter. You should use the holes marked as 25XX (closer to the USB plug): Place the 1.8V adapter in the holes and lock it with the lever. Be sure that the arrow on the adapter is facing the black lever (opposite side of USB plug): Now take the breakout board with pin headers: and plug it into the other 1.8V adapter, be sure that numbers 1-4 on the breakout match the numbers 1 and 4 on the adapter: Numbers should be visible on the upper side after assembling: Next, take the WSON8 probe and locate the white dot on the needles side (it will indicate the first reference pin, although you may use any other corner pin): Check which wire is connecting to this pin (the connection should be 1 to 1). In my case it is white wire and it will be used as reference to connect the wires to the breakout board: The wires should follow the same order of colors as on the probe (keep them straight, and do not cross). Repeat with the other 4 wires on the other side of the probe: Now the connection is ready. Time to locate the flash chip of the board. Flashing Connect the CH341A USB plug to the host machine which will be doing the flashing process (optionally use the USB extension cord for convenience). Locate the flash chip on the MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 board: Locate the first pin on the flash chip (marked with a circle on the flash chip package and indicated by number 1 printed on the board - red circle): Attach the WSON8 probe matching the first pin of the probe (white wire) and first pin of the flash chip: Now on the Linux machine check if the flash is detected using a sample command sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r firmware.bin You should see something like this: flashrom v1.2-567-gf4eb405 on Linux 5 .19.9-200.fc36.x86_64 ( x86_64 ) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops ( clk_id: 1 , resolution: 1ns ) . Found Winbond flash chip \"W25Q256.W\" ( 32768 kB, SPI ) on ch341a_spi. Reading flash... done . You don't need to wait for the command completion and interrupt it with Ctrl+C shortcut, it just serves as a confirmation of good connection. If you decide to interrupt it, reset the CH341A programmer by unpluging and repluging it to USB port. Now stabilize your hand holding the WSON8 probe on the flash chip and invoke the real flashing command (e.g. if your original/working firmware backup is saved as firmware_backup.bin ): sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w firmware_backup.bin Note that USB programmers are pretty slow, the whole operation make take several minutes (can be 10-15 minutes in worst case). At the end of operation you should see: flashrom v1.2-567-gf4eb405 on Linux 5 .19.9-200.fc36.x86_64 ( x86_64 ) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops ( clk_id: 1 , resolution: 1ns ) .

SMBIOS unique data recovery Serial number format and recovery SMBIOS specification sections 7.2 and 7.3 defines two spaces for serial number: the system serial number and baseboard serial number. The original MSI PRO Z690-A firmware provides only the baseboard serial number. In case you have lost your serial number in the process of flashing Dasharo or newer MSI firmware, there is a way to retrieve it. The board has a QR code printed on the mainboard between the chipset heatsink and dPGU PCIe slot: If you read the QR code with your smartphone you will get the full serial number. The serial number has the format 07D25xx_LyzEaaaaaa where: 07D25 - is the board model, i.e. MS-7D25 for this particular board xx is the mainboard revision which should match the revision imprinted between the M2_1 slot and dGPU slot. E.g. xx=11 means VER:1.1 yz is the manufacturing date in hex, i.e. y is the month, z is the year, for example A1 means October 202 1 , 12 means January 202 2 aaaaaa is the unique 6-digit number which is imprinted under the serial number QR code System UUID format and recovery SMBIOS specification section 7.2 defines a field for unique system identification with a special number called UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier). UUID is specified by RFC 4122 . MSI firmware provides the system UUID in the SMBIOS system information structure. The problem with UUID is that it cannot be recovered if the backup binary or SMBIOS logs are lost. You can backup the SMBIOS information with our Dasharo Tools Suite bootablestick . The dmidecode.log will have all the necessary information. Things we know about MSI system UUID: UUID format is as follows: 33221100-5544-7766-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF , the hex numbers represent the order of bytes in memory for the little-endian format as required by SMBIOS MSI UUIDs do not conform to any of the RFC 4122 UUID variants/versions (the bits responsible for UUID version and variant identification are not constant across multiple boards) the last octet group AABBCCDDEEFF is equal to the MAC address of the on-board Intel i225 Ethernet, so be sure to NOT share the UUID with anybody as it contains system sensitive information the first four groups are either random numbers or some cryptographically acquired value from e.g. combination of some board data, unfortunately it is not known by us The MAC address is printed on a sticker placed on the 2x2 SATA connector: SMBIOS data migration For Dasharo simply follow the Initial Deployment how to migrate the data. For MSI firmware you will probably need an AMI DMI/SMBIOS editor to save those values back if you do not have a backup binary.","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"unified/msi/recovery/#recovery","text":"","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"unified/msi/recovery/#intro","text":"This project is in early development phase.

It assumes some knowledge about external flashing and is primarily aimed at technicians performing initial installation and not for end users of the devices. Installing Dasharo Initial Installation 12th Gen (Alder Lake) 11th Gen (Tiger Lake) During the initial installation of Dasharo, you should deploy the supported Intel ME version (and configuration) on the device. Since vendor firmware has enabled Intel Boot Guard and BIOS Guard, it is not possible to do this from within the operating system and external flashing of the whole flash chip using a programmer like the CH341a is required. Publicly released binaries do not contain ME binary. If you need an Intel ME update for your device, contact us via already established commercial support channel. Preparation Install flashrom: apt update apt upgrade sudo apt -y install flashrom BIOS installation Steps for installing Dasharo BIOS: Remove the bottom cover of the laptop. NS5x / NS7x NV4x Disconnect the primary battery. (1) Disconnect the CMOS battery. (2) Attach a WSON-8 probe to the SPI flash chip. (3) For TGL devices use SOIC clip instead of WSON Backup the current firmware, in case you want to be able to restore it at some point: flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r bios_backup.rom Install Dasharo BIOS, replacing [path] with the path to the firmware image you want to flash, e.g. novacustom_ns5x_adl_full_v1.4.0.rom flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w [ path ] Detach the WSON-8 probe. Connect the primary battery and reconnect the CMOS battery Power on the laptop. The laptop may shut down once after training the memory. EC firmware installation Currently, the latest flashrom release lacks support for flashing ITE embedded controllers such as the ones present in NovaCustom laptops. Because of this, we need to build flashrom from source. Run the following commands on the target laptop: Install build dependencies: apt update apt upgrade apt install git build-essential debhelper pkg-config libpci-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libftdi1-dev meson Obtain source code: git clone https://github.com/dasharo/flashrom.git cd flashrom Build flashrom: make sudo make install Make a backup of the EC firmware: Remember to store the backup on the separate device in case flashing fails. flashrom -p ite_ec -r ec_backup.rom Install the EC firmware: Warning: After running this command, the internal keyboard and power button will stop responding until the device is power cycled (all power must be removed, including the internal battery). Be prepared to disconnect the battery after updating the EC. Alternatively, you can boot up the laptop without the battery connected and power it from an AC adapter. Then, once the EC update is complete, disconnect the AC adapter to power off the laptop. Run the following command, replacing [path] with the path to the EC firmware you want to flash, e.g. novacustom_ns5x_adl_ec_v1.4.0.rom flashrom -p ite_ec -w [ path ] Successful installation of Dasharo EC finishes the initial deployment process. Initial deployment To ensure a smooth deployment process, it is recommended to use the latest version of DTS available from the releases page . Once you have obtained it, you can then proceed with following the Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment section procedure. This will help you set up Dasharo effectively and without manual intervention. If something went wrong or EC installation was not done, the firmware will print an error string during boot: OR In such case please follow the EC firmware update instructions for a specific board variant.","title":"Initial deployment"},{"location":"unified/novacustom/initial-deployment/#initial-deployment","text":"","title":"Initial Deployment"},{"location":"unified/novacustom/initial-deployment/#intro","text":"This document is a guide for the initial installation of Dasharo on a supported device.

If the temperature is equal to one of the temperatures of the points on the curve, set the speed from that point on the curve If the temperature is between points on the curve: slope = ( right_point_speed - left_point_speed ) /right_point_temperature - left_point_temperature ) speed = slope* ( temperature - left_point_temperature ) + left_point_speed Divide the PWM value by 2.55 to get the percentage to compare.

Test configuration data FIRMWARE = Dasharo Platform with TPM 2.0 module present. TPM003.001 indicating that TPM PPI is supported. Test setup Proceed with the Test cases common documentation section. Test steps Power on the DUT. Boot into the firmware setup using the BIOS_SETUP_KEY . Enter the Device Manager -> TCG2 Configuration . Scroll down to the bottom of the page using arrow down key. Switch active PCR banks depending on the currently active banks.: if both SHA1 and SHA256 are active, deactivate SHA1 if SHA1 only is active, activate SHA256 and deactivate SHA1 if SHA256 only is active, activate SHA1 and deactivate SHA256 Press F10 to save and go back to the main setup page using ESC key. Use the Reset option on the main setup page to reboot the DUT. After reset a prompt should appear explaining a TPM state change request has been made. Press F12 as instructed to apply changes. The DUT will need to reboot again. After the reboot enter the Device Manager -> TCG2 Configuration again. Scroll down to the bottom of the page using arrow down key. Verify the active PCR banks were changed according to the choice made in step 5. NOTE: Certain TPMs like Intel PTT (fTPM) do not allow to set more than one active PCR bank at a given time, that is why the test case keeps only one bank active. Discrete TPMs may have multiple banks enabled simultaneously, but it is TPM module and TPM firmware dependent. Expected result The prompt appears at step 8. The requested changes are applied as verified in step 11. The prompt seen on the DUT screen has the following format (example change from SHA256 to SHA1): A configuration change was requested to PCR bank(s) of this computer's TPM (Trusted Platform Module) WARNING: Changing the PCR bank(s) of the boot measurements may prevent the Operating System from properly processing the measurements. Please check if your Operating System supports the new PCR bank(s). WARNING: Secrets in the TPM that are bound to the boot state of your machine may become unusable. Current PCRBanks is 0x2. (SHA256) New PCRBanks is 0x1. (SHA1) Press F12 change the boot measurements to use PCR bank(s) of the TPM Press ESC to reject this change request and continue","title":"TPM support"},{"location":"unified-test-documentation/dasharo-security/200-tpm-support/#dasharo-security-tpm-support","text":"","title":"Dasharo Security: TPM Support"},{"location":"unified-test-documentation/dasharo-security/200-tpm-support/#test-cases-common-documentation","text":"Test setup Proceed with the Generic test setup: firmware .

Simply connect the power supply to ATX compatible connectors on the mainboard (SSIPWR1, SSI12V1, SSI12V2). SPI BIOS SPI flash is a socketed DIP-8. There is no simple way to attach to it with any tools. That is why we have thought about the qspimux made by Felix Held which can attach to various SPI modules footprints and sockets. The DIP-8 adapter is put into the DIP-8 socket on the mainboard, which allows attaching the qspimux SPI multiplexer. The multiplexer is responsible for switching between the external SPI lines and the mainboard lines routed to the external SPI flash chip. The external flash chip is soldered on a SOIC8 adapter, which is connected to the qspimux. The connection of the RTE and qspimux is as follows: RTE header J7 pin qspimux J101 pin 1 (VCC) 2 (VCC_PROG) 2 (GND) 7 (GND) 3 (CS) 1 (CS_PROG#) 4 (SCLK) 6 (CLK_PROG) 5 (MISO) 8 (IO0_DI_PROG) 6 (MOSI) 3 (IO1_DO_PROG) 7 (NC) Not connected 8 (NC) Not connected Additionally, one has to tie the IO3_HOLD_PROG (qspimux pin 4) high, so connect it to the 3.3V permanently. Another additional GPIO is required to control the routing of SPI lines. The MUX_SEL (qspimux pin 9) decides whether the programmer is allowed to access the SPI flash or the mainboard. One more GPIO is used to control state of #WP of the flash chip by connecting GPIO to IO2_WP_PROG. The proposed connections used: RTE GPIO400 to control MUX_SEL RTE GPIO401 to control IO3_HOLD_PROG RTE GPIO402 to control IO2_WP_PROG Simple flashing script looks as follows: # select flash <-> programmer echo \"0\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio400/value # deassert SPI HOLD# echo \"1\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio401/value flashrom -w firmware.bin -p linux_spi:dev = /dev/spidev1.0,spispeed = 16000 # select flash <-> board echo \"1\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio400/value Controlling state of #WP: # configure direction of the pin echo \"out\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio402/direction # deassert WP pin to disable hardware protection of status registers echo \"1\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio402/value # assert WP pin to enable hardware protection of status registers echo \"0\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio402/value RTE header J10 pin qspimux J101 pin 1 (GPIO400) 9 (MUX_SEL) 2 (GPIO401) 4 (IO3_HOLD_PROG) 3 (GPIO402) 5 (IO2_WP_PROG) qspimux schematic is available here Serial Asus KGPE-D16 has a DB9 serial connector for the debug UART. Connect it to the RTE via RS232 DB9 cable. TPM Asus KGPE-D16 has an LPC header for TPM or debugging. Since there is no other option to connect a TPM, we use the header for that purpose. IMPORTANT: Use only TPM modules which match their pinout with the board's header! Using a spider web connection degrades the signal quality to the point where CPU cannot properly talk to TPM via LPC bus. Tested with PC Engines TPM module and failed to succeed this way. Designing and producing proper TPM header and/or reliable adapter, could solve this problem. The TwPM project could help here in the future. TPM modules that were tested and verified to work in 3mdeb lab with coreboot: ASUS TPM-L R2.0 module (chip Infineon SLB9665 TT 2.0) ASUS TPM 1.2 Rev 1.02h module (chip Infineon SLB9635 TT 1.2) Power management Asus KGPE-D16 provides a front panel pin header (PANEL1): RTE header J11 pin Asus KGPE-D16 8 (OC buffer output) PANEL1 pin 11 (PWR) 9 (OC buffer output) PANEL1 pin 17 (RESET) Additionally, connect one of the PANEL1 ground pins to one of the ground pins on RTE. Manunal For more details about the KGPE-D16, refer to the manual . Theory of operation Flashing There are two RTEs connected to two Asus KGPE-D16 boards: 192.168.20.15 192.168.4.111 Both boards are equipped with the qspimux and a replaced flash chip (Winbond W25Q64FV 8MB). The flash chip is attached to the qspimux with an adapter available with qspimux. Flashing may be done via the commands shown earlier or the flash script which is present in the root directory of the RTE: ./flash.sh coreboot.rom The script will automatically power off the board and update flash chip contents using flashrom. After the operation is finished the routing of SPI signals is restored to the platform. The flash chip adapter In order to provide an easy way to protect the SPI flash chip one may use a DIP-8 to SOIC-8 adapter with a special long pin header for WP pin jumper. It allows to use a SOIC-8 packaged flash in the DIP-8 socket and easily place a jumper to protect the flash. In order to assembly the adapter you will need the target SPI flash chip (we use either Winbond W25Q64FV (8MB) or W25Q128JV (16MB)), male pin headers 2.54 mm pitch (6 pins) male long pin headers 2.54 mm pitch (2 pins) for the WP jumper SOIC-8 to DIP-8 adapter soldering station and the solder The build shall look like this: Such adapters are now available in our online shop for purchase. For more details how to enable SPI flash protection refer to SPI Flash protection page . Power management RTE can control the power of the board with the RteCtrl command-line application, or with the web GUI ( RteCtrl ) available at RTE's IP address port 8000. Possible commands are: ./RteCtrl -pon # power on the platform ./RteCtrl -poff # force 5seconds power button power off ./RteCtrl -reset # briefly assert platform reset pin to perform reset It is also possible to control the ATX power supply by disconnecting it from the power socket. For this special purpose, Sonoff S20 is used to remotely control the power socket activity. Sonoff IP to RTE IP mapping: RTE IP 192.168.20.15 - Sonoff IP 192.168.4.125 RTE IP 192.168.4.111 - Sonoff IP 192.168.4.146 Sonoffs respond to rest API requests to enable or disable the power socket. Shell scripts have been added to RTE root directories to ease the control of power of the KGPE-D16 platform: #!/bin/bash SONOFF_IP = 192 .168.4.125 if [[ \" $1 \" == \"off\" ]] ; then wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay/turn_off --method = POST elif [[ \" $1 \" == \"on\" ]] ; then wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay/turn_on --method = POST elif [[ \" $1 \" == \"show\" ]] ; then wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay echo -e '\\n' else echo -e \"\\$1 == on|off|show|toggle\\nEdit this script to set the sonoff ip.\" echo -e 'Current state:' wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay echo -e '\\n' fi To turn off the power from the platform ./sonoff.sh off and to turn it on ./sonoff.sh on . Invoking the script without any argument will print the current state of the switch. Serial console access A serial port is very useful in debugging and as a remote console of the system on the platform. The serial port of KGPE-D16 is connected to the RTE's serial port which can be accessed on RTE with /dev/ttyS1 . One may use minicom directly or take advantage of the ser2net service running on RTE which exposes the serial port over the network. The serial port can be accessed remotely like this telnet RTE_IP 13541 , e.g.: telnet 192 .168.20.15 13541 Demo A short demo presenting RTE capabilities with KGPE-D16: Remote access If you are interested in developing coreboot on KGPE-D16 and have some spare time, there is a possibility to obtain access to the hardware.

We protect the bootblock only, since it is the stage responsible for measurements and verification of next stages. Setting flash protection using flashrom NOTE: be sure to update the firmware first before proceeding! Estimating bootblock size and protection range First let's see how much space we need to protect. Take your coreboot.rom file and use cbfstool to show its contents: cd /path/to/coreboot/build ./cbfstool coreboot.rom print FMAP REGION: COREBOOT Name Offset Type Size Comp cbfs master header 0x0 cbfs header 32 none fallback/romstage 0x80 stage 171040 none fallback/ramstage 0x29d40 stage 98703 LZMA ( 229532 decompressed ) config 0x41f40 raw 709 none revision 0x42240 raw 723 none build_info 0x42540 raw 101 none fallback/dsdt.aml 0x42600 raw 7055 none cmos.default 0x441c0 cmos_default 256 none cmos_layout.bin 0x44300 cmos_layout 3676 none fallback/postcar 0x451c0 stage 21216 none img/nvramcui 0x4a500 simple elf 70630 none fallback/payload 0x5b940 simple elf 69936 none payload_config 0x6cac0 raw 1621 none payload_revision 0x6d140 raw 237 none pci8086,10d3.rom 0x6d280 raw 82944 none etc/sercon-port 0x816c0 raw 8 none ( empty ) 0x81700 null 8128932 none bootblock 0xffcac0 bootblock 13056 none The bootblock is taking slightly more than 12KB of space on the bottom of the flash. Converting 12KB to hex would be equal to 0x3000 but we must cover a little bit more than that. Let's see what protection ranges are available for the chip (running from the tagret machine to be protected): ./flashrom -p internal --wp-list ... Available write protection ranges: start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00000000 ( none ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00001000 ( lower 1 /2048 ) start = 0x007ff000 length = 0x00001000 ( upper 1 /2048 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00002000 ( lower 1 /1024 ) start = 0x007fe000 length = 0x00002000 ( upper 1 /1024 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00004000 ( lower 1 /512 ) start = 0x007fc000 length = 0x00004000 ( upper 1 /512 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00008000 ( lower 1 /256 ) start = 0x007f8000 length = 0x00008000 ( upper 1 /256 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00020000 ( lower 1 /64 ) start = 0x007e0000 length = 0x00020000 ( upper 1 /64 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00040000 ( lower 1 /32 ) start = 0x007c0000 length = 0x00040000 ( upper 1 /32 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00080000 ( lower 1 /16 ) start = 0x00780000 length = 0x00080000 ( upper 1 /16 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00100000 ( lower 1 /8 ) start = 0x00700000 length = 0x00100000 ( upper 1 /8 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00200000 ( lower 1 /4 ) start = 0x00600000 length = 0x00200000 ( upper 1 /4 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00400000 ( lower 1 /2 ) start = 0x00400000 length = 0x00400000 ( upper 1 /2 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00600000 ( lower 3 /4 ) start = 0x00200000 length = 0x00600000 ( upper 3 /4 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00700000 ( lower 7 /8 ) start = 0x00100000 length = 0x00700000 ( upper 7 /8 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00780000 ( lower 15 /16 ) start = 0x00080000 length = 0x00780000 ( upper 15 /16 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007c0000 ( lower 31 /32 ) start = 0x00040000 length = 0x007c0000 ( upper 31 /32 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007e0000 ( lower 63 /64 ) start = 0x00020000 length = 0x007e0000 ( upper 63 /64 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007f8000 ( lower 255 /256 ) start = 0x00008000 length = 0x007f8000 ( upper 255 /256 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007fc000 ( lower 511 /512 ) start = 0x00004000 length = 0x007fc000 ( upper 511 /512 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007fe000 ( lower 1023 /1024 ) start = 0x00002000 length = 0x007fe000 ( upper 1023 /1024 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007ff000 ( lower 2047 /2048 ) start = 0x00001000 length = 0x007ff000 ( upper 2047 /2048 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00800000 ( all ) The output abvoe comes from Winbond W25Q64FV, a 8MB chip. Bootblock is always mapped to the bottom of the flash. 1MB is equal to 0x100000 so 8MB would be 0x800000. We need at least 0x4000 (16KB) to be protected starting at the bottom of the flash. And fortunately we have found our best match: start=0x007fc000 length=0x00004000 (upper 1/512) . Clearing SPI write protection Now that we have selected the desired range to protect, it is time to check the current protection status: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-status ... WP config bits: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 0 CMP = 0 SEC = 0 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 0 BP0 = 0 Protection range: start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00000000 ( none ) Protection mode: disabled The protection range should be set to zeros and all WP config bits should be cleared. If you see some bits were not cleared, ensure the WP pin jumper on the flash is not placed and invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-disable ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0 ,0 now that we have a clear state of the flash protection we may proceed with enabling the right range. Setting protection range Copy the range base and length and invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0x007fc000,0x00004000 Setting SPI status register protection Flashrom should report Sucessfully set the requested protection range. . Now set the status register protection so the range protection cannot be changed: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-enable Flashrom should report Sucessfully set the requested mode. . Verifying SPI write protection To check whether the settings are desired invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-status ... WP config bits: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 1 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 Protection range: start = 0x007fc000 length = 0x00004000 ( upper 1 /512 ) Protection mode: hardware If it matches what you have wanted to set it is time to lock the status register protection bit (SRP0) from being changed. SRP0 protects the CMP, SEC, TB and BPx bits from being changed. In order to lock the SRP0 bit you have to place the jumper on the WP pin and tie it to ground (GND). This will assert the WP pin and prevent any WP config bits from being changed. To verify it invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-disable ... Writing new WP configuration failed during verification: Expected configuration: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 0 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 Actual configuration: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 1 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 You should get the above result. Changing the protection range Now if you want to reprogram the protection range, you need to take off the jumper and invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-disable Now you should get Sucessfully set the requested mode. now. Check the WP status: WP config bits: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 0 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 Protection range: start = 0x007fc000 length = 0x00004000 ( upper 1 /512 ) Protection mode: disabled It must indicate Protection mode: disabled . Now you may reconfigure the range, e.g. ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0x007e0000,0x00020000 And proceed with enabling protection and setting back the jumper. Setting flash protection for vboot In case when vboot is enabled the protection range must be extended in order to cover other parts of the firmware. Vboot model assumes there is a read-only copy of the coreboot and payload called recovery partition. The recovery partition is supposed to be protected with a SPI write protection. The read-only region contains the bootblock, verstage (vboot stage used to verify other firmware components) and vboot keys and all other stages required to boot the platform in case of emergency. Typically the read-only partition occupies a space that matches the possible write protected regions of the flash chip. There are also read-write partitions (up to 2) that contain an updatable copies of the coreboot and payload. Unlike read-only partitions, read-write partitions are being verified using the signatures put into the read-write partitions. vboot checks the signature and decides whether read-write partition is safe to boot, otherwise it proceeds with execution of recovery firmware. The boot flow is shown on the diagram below: In order to properly protect the firmware, one has to lock whole WP_RO region define by flashmap in coreboot. To locate the region offset and size one has to use cbfstool to retrieve layout: cd /path/to/coreboot/build ./cbfstool coreboot.rom layout -w This image contains the following sections that can be accessed with this tool: 'RW_MISC' ( read-only, size 524288 , offset 0 ) 'UNIFIED_MRC_CACHE' ( read-only, size 131072 , offset 0 ) 'RECOVERY_MRC_CACHE' ( size 65536 , offset 0 ) 'RW_MRC_CACHE' ( size 65536 , offset 65536 ) 'SMMSTORE' ( preserve, size 262144 , offset 131072 ) 'CONSOLE' ( size 131072 , offset 393216 ) 'RW_NVRAM' ( size 16384 , offset 524288 ) 'RW_SECTION_A' ( read-only, size 5750784 , offset 540672 ) 'VBLOCK_A' ( size 8192 , offset 540672 ) 'FW_MAIN_A' ( CBFS, size 5742528 , offset 548864 ) 'RW_FWID_A' ( size 64 , offset 6291392 ) 'WP_RO' ( read-only, size 2097152 , offset 6291456 ) 'RO_VPD' ( preserve, size 16384 , offset 6291456 ) 'RO_SECTION' ( read-only, size 2080768 , offset 6307840 ) 'FMAP' ( read-only, size 2048 , offset 6307840 ) 'RO_FRID' ( size 64 , offset 6309888 ) 'RO_FRID_PAD' ( size 1984 , offset 6309952 ) 'GBB' ( size 16384 , offset 6311936 ) 'COREBOOT' ( CBFS, size 2060288 , offset 6328320 ) It is at least possible to perform the read action on every section listed above. The above example shows the KGPE-D16 8MB target with vboot enabled. The WP_RO section is at offset of 6291456 bytes from the beginning of the flash and has size of 2097152 bytes. These numbers are in decimal, so one must convert them to hex. Either use an online hex converter or use the command in bash like a pro :) printf \"0x%x\\n\" 6291456 0x600000 printf \"0x%x\\n\" 2097152 0x200000 So our WP range would be 2MB at 6MB offset start=0x00600000 length=0x00200000 (upper 1/4) . But before proceeding with setting the WP range, one may want to sign the firmware with own vboot keys. The Dasharo build come by default with Google vboot developer keys, so to take advantage of vboot, one should sign the binary before flashing and setting the WP range. Refer to vboot signing . Unfortunately the utilities support only 2 RW partitions for resiging. Otherwise a whole image must be rebuilt. After custo mkeys have been used to sign the ifmrware image and the image has been flashed proceed with enalbing the protection: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0x00600000,0x00200000 Then proceed with Setting SPI status register protection and Verifying SPI write protection . At this point you should have your coreboot firmware with vboot well protected and ready to go. Place the jumper in order to prevent any changes to the configuration.","title":"SPI write protection"},{"location":"variants/asus_kgpe_d16/spi-wp/#spi-hardware-write-protection","text":"In order to from a Root of Trust in the firmware, e.g. in the immutable piece of firmware code for Static Root of Trust of Measurement one has to ensure the protection of this piece of code.

Either use an online hex converter or use the command in bash like a pro :) printf \"0x%x\\n\" 6291456 0x600000 printf \"0x%x\\n\" 2097152 0x200000 So our WP range would be 2MB at 6MB offset start=0x00600000 length=0x00200000 (upper 1/4) . But before proceeding with setting the WP range, one may want to sign the firmware with own vboot keys. The Dasharo build come by default with Google vboot developer keys, so to take advantage of vboot, one should sign the binary before flashing and setting the WP range. Refer to vboot signing . Unfortunately the utilities support only 2 RW partitions for resiging. Otherwise a whole image must be rebuilt. After custo mkeys have been used to sign the ifmrware image and the image has been flashed proceed with enalbing the protection: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0x00600000,0x00200000 Then proceed with Setting SPI status register protection and Verifying SPI write protection . At this point you should have your coreboot firmware with vboot well protected and ready to go. Place the jumper in order to prevent any changes to the configuration.","title":"Setting flash protection for vboot"},{"location":"variants/asus_kgpe_d16/test-matrix/","text":"Test matrix About The test matrix is used to determine the scope of tests which the DUT is subjected from before the release of the new binary.

Power on the machine. You should see a warning that the service jumper is active. Press F1 to proceed and boot to your Linux system. Initial deployment To ensure a smooth deployment process, it is recommended to use the latest version of DTS available from the releases page . Once you have obtained it, you can then proceed with following the Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment section procedure. This will help you set up Dasharo effectively and without manual intervention. Verification If everything went well (flashrom has verified the flash content), Shut down the machine, move the jumper to the original place Power on the machine. After rebooting, you should see the Dasharo Workstation logo when booting. When the logo appears, you may press Esc to select the boot device if you want to reboot from another source. From that point you can use firmware update methods to update your firmware. Troubleshooting If you do not see the logo after a few seconds, something probably went wrong, or you encountered a bug. If the LED on the power button shines white, that means the platform booted correctly. If the power button LED constantly shines in orange color, that means you have hit an error. The LED will start blinking soon. If you see the logo and after that system does not starts (black screen), please take the following steps: Put a bootable USB stick to the USB port. Restart the computer using the power button. Press the Esc key to enter a boot menu. Choose a USB drive from the list. Re-install the operating system. Common deployment problems you can find in FAQ . Ubuntu installation Ubuntu legacy installers have problems with graphical setup mode. When you see this error: graphics initialization failed Error setting up gfxboot boot:_ You need a workaround to proceed with the installation. To boot the installer, type live-install and press ENTER . It will boot to Ubuntu Live, and the installer will launch automatically. Version affected: Dasharo Workstation v0.1. If you see blinking yellow LED and black screen after reboot: 1. Unplug the power supply cable 2. Wait for the 30s 3.

There is an ongoing discussion about the methodology of the openness metric. BIOS versions used in the analysis Dasharo v1.0.0 AMI BIOS v1.0 MSI original BIOS from AMI In the case of the AMI BIOS, the entire image should be considered proprietary. There are several parts of the image that have a well-known structure or make use of a public standard. However, to decode these structures, one needs to employ reverse-engineering tools and techniques to know what structures are present. For simplicity we treat UEFI variables as BIOS data. All empty padding regions between FFS and all volume free spaces are treated as unused space. Dasharo BIOS CBFS regions The below table shows only a single FMAP region COREBOOT. There are also two RW vboot partitions containing copies of the same components from COREBOOT region (except the verstage, bootblock and cbfs master header). Note that there are other regions to store non-volatile data like MRC cache, UEFI variables or vboot state backup.

The 63445 bytes will be added to closed source pool and removed from the payload size in the calculations. Note that UEFIPayload has support for Option ROM loading, for example to support external graphics card output during POST.

Summary for all 3 regions: Whole flash image To get the overall BIOS region and full image percentage of open source code we ignore unused space or FMAP regions which do not have CBFS and are merely data generated during build process or boot process. The BIOS region percentage is calculated as follows: (COREBOOT region open-source size + FW_MAIN_A/B open-source size * 2) * 100 divided by (COREBOOT region code size + FW_MAIN_A/B code size * 2) . Full image code only percentage is calculated as follows: (COREBOOT region open-source size + FW_MAIN_A/B open-source size * 2) * 100 divided by (ME + descriptor + COREBOOT region code size + FW_MAIN_A/B code size * 2) . Region Size (bytes) Open-source percent (bytes) descriptor 0x1000 0% ME 0x3D9000 0% unused hole 0xC26000 N/A BIOS 0x1000000 50.5% Summary 0x2000000 38% Comparison of pure code open-source vs closed-source.

Without vboot, BIOS region free space would reach over 70%! While BIOS region's Dasharo Openness Score is 50%, when compared with Intel ME and descriptor, the overall Dasharo Openness Score is 38% ME share is different because the size of BIOS code is different on both distributions Summary Image Open-source percent (bytes) AMI BIOS 0% Dasharo 38% Dasharo code takes approximately 4MB of space for a single region + some space for data which is less than 1MB. This reduces the single copy of firmware from 8MB to roughly 4MB compared to AMI BIOS. This is roughly 50% reduction of TCB! More over, given the 50% share in size of open-source code, Dasharo liberates BIOS in 75%! Few conclusions: Although the reduction of TCB is 50% it cannot be seen on the charts due to 3 copies of the firmware in Dasharo image. It also effectively increases the percentage of BIOS code both open and closed source in the full image. More significant differences would be seen with vboot disabled, there would be more free space and even less BIOS code both open and closed","title":"Openness score"},{"location":"variants/msi_z690/openness_analysis/#dasharo-openness-score","text":"This document aims to compare the openness of Dasharo firmware and AMI BIOS for MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 WiFI.

Touchpad hotkey enablement (Linux) The touchpad hotkey needs extra setup to function correctly under Linux. To enable the touchpad hotkey to work under Linux, follow the steps below: Create a file /etc/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb with the following contents: evdev:atkbd:dmi:bvn*:bvr*:svnNotebook:pnNS5x_NS7xPU:* KEYBOARD_KEY_f7 = 191 KEYBOARD_KEY_f8 = 191 Execute the following commands: sudo systemd-hwdb update sudo udevadm trigger After executing these steps, it should be possible to enable and disable the touchpad using the touchpad hotkey (Fn+F1) on the keyboard when using GNOME. Touchpad multi-touch support (NS7x / 17-inch model, Linux) On NS7x an additional fix is necessary to enable multi-touch on Linux. Create a file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-psmouse.conf with the following contents: blacklist psmouse and then run the following commands: sudo depmod -a sudo update-initramfs -u Now reboot your computer to apply the changes. Installing updates and drivers (Windows 11) Several features on Windows 11 (i. e. suspending the device) may not work or work unexpectedly without installing all of the updates and drivers. To install all of them, log into system, connect the device to the mains and Internet, then follow the steps below: Press the Windows button on the keypad. Type Windows Update Settings in the search and press Enter . Select the Check for updates bar to start installing available updates and drivers. During this process previously selected bar might be changed to Restart now or Retry , so click them if something hasn't been installed yet, something has gone wrong or restart is just required. The entire process may take up to 30 minutes. Select the Advanced options option in the Windows Update Settings window. Locate the Optional updates option and click on it.

It\u2019s the main tool used in Ubuntu Certification program. You can use this software without any modification to check if your system is behaving correctly or you can develop your own set of tests to check your needs. Checkbox optionally generates test reports in different formats (JSON, HTML, etc.) that can be used to easily share the results of a test session. Checkbox comparison - vendor firmware vs Dasharo Testing assumptions Tests have been conducted on the same OS version (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS). Tests have been conducted on the same device, firstly with vendor firmware and secondly with Dasharo firmware (version 1.2.1). Test results Test results - vendor firmware: PASSED: 74, FAILED: 80, NOT SUPPORTED: 25. Test results - Dasharo firmware: PASSED: 74, FAILED: 80, NOT SUPPORTED: 25.

Device specification NovaCustom NV4x system firmware Intel i7-1165G7 (Tiger Lake ULV platform) Samsung 980PRO NVMe SSD 2x SO-DIMM DDR4 system memory Optional NVIDIA discrete graphics Dasharo coreboot-based firmware Firmware stored on a SPI flash chip, flashable internally via flashrom Update protocol The device is flashable internally via flashrom No special unlocks necessary for flashing the required BIOS flash portions (only requirement is that UEFI Secure Boot is disabled while updating) Feasibility analysis Tiger Lake-U is supported in flashrom Present since this commit , not yet released to stable as of 14.01.2022 flashrom is supported in fwupd flashrom plugin is enabled by default in many common desktop Linux distributions, including Ubuntu (starting with 21.10) and Arch Linux enabling a device in the flashrom plugin is a matter of adding device-specific entries to the plugin quirk list Potential risk: vboot support in fwupd flashrom supports flashing vboot rw slots, which are coreboot images located within the BIOS partition of the flash however, fwupd only implements flashing the entire BIOS region of the SPI flash, which includes other firmware components such as vboot keys, vboot recovery partition and user settings the device currently has vboot partially implemented - the BIOS flash is not protected and the binaries are signed with (public) developer keys this means we can currently update the BIOS using the traditional fwupd update path once we decide to change the vboot keys and lock down the rest of the, flash, proper vboot support will need to be implemented in fwupd until then, it will not be possible to enable vboot fully Further steps: Vboot support In case full vboot support in fwupd is desired, the following are currently missing and need to be implemented: Support reading and processing VBNV (Vboot non-volatile store) data in fwupd: this store contains information about the current vboot state, e.g. currently booted slot (A/B/Recovery), recovery reason, firmware signature verification status. This information is stored in CMOS, but the exact offset varies by device - so a method for determining the offset is also required. For Google Chromebooks, this offset is exposed in a Chromebook-specific ACPI device which we cannot use in non-Chromebook device. An alternative interface or possibly a quirk in fwupd's flashrom plugin will need to be added (though this approach is not preferred by fwupd maintainers). Support for flashing fmap regions in fwupd's flashrom plugin: currently, fwupd only attempts to read flash layout from the Intel Flash Descriptor located in the flash. This only allows fwupd to flash the entire BIOS region, while vboot requires only a portion of the BIOS partition to be updated at a given time, with some of the BIOS partition being read-only. This means that with vboot fully enabled, updating will fail by attempting to write to a read-only portion of the flash. Vboot partitions (slots) are a subset of the bios partition and are defined in FMAP (flashmap). Support for it will need to be implemented in fwupd (possible by utilizing libflashrom). Additionally, some user settings like boot order and setup options are stored in a separate FMAP region, so implementing FMAP support in fwupd will allow us to preserve them across firmware updates. Vboot A/B slot support In Google Chromebooks, the firmware updater only updates one slot at a time and if it succeeds (the device reboots into it successfully and works stably), then it will also update the other slot to the same (now confirmed good) firmware. fwupd does not currently support anything like this, so support for it will also need to be implemented.

We understand that many of you have eagerly awaited the next PC Engines firmware release. Rest assured that our commitment to supporting the PC Engines firmware remains strong, and we are working hard to bring you new features through the upcoming Dasharo firmware distribution. We appreciate your patience and continued support. We regret to inform the community that v4.17.0.3 was the last version of the firmware sponsored by PC Engines. However, 3mdeb has since released v4.19.0.1 , the final version delivered to the community using the existing model. As some may know, 3mdeb is a small open-source firmware consulting company based in Poland. Our team consists of passionate engineers and developers from open-source software, firmware, and hardware communities, frequent conference speakers, and people who love to tinker with bits. Every day we develop bleeding-edge low-level security solutions using top open-source frameworks. We are committed to continuing support and PC Engines hardware in the open-source firmware community but can't afford that on our dime. Since February 2016, we have made 87 binary releases for all PC Engines hardware platforms from apu1 through famous apu2 up to apu7. We published over 30k test results from our automated testing framework. Thanks to community feedback, we created extensive documentation . Our firmware development effort extended the lifetime value of PC Engines hardware. Most notable examples were: CPU Core Performance Boost feature enabling - blog DRAM Error Correction Code enabling - blog AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor enabling - issue tracker and many small things like a watchdog or SPI flash lockdown. According to PC Engines EOL statement apu2 / apu3 series availability will be: \"Based on an AMD embedded CPU, this platform should have good long term availability. This CPU should be available until 2024 according to AMD.\" We would like to continue support for PC Engines firmware through our Dasharo open-source firmware distribution. Further releases could include regular maintenance updates and new features such as UEFI compatibility, fwupd, Verified Boot, UEFI Setup password, DMA protection, and more. For a complete list of planned enhancements, please visit the dasharo-issues repository on GitHub. Your support will play a crucial role in determining the roadmap and the speed of its implementation. We hope you will support our efforts to bring these new features and improvements to the PC Engines firmware. We are exploring the possibility of implementing a subscription model for firmware updates. We would like to hear from you to ensure that the pricing option is fair and reasonable for our community. We have created a survey to gather your thoughts and preferences on pricing. Your feedback is important to us and will help us make informed decisions about the future of our offerings.

This document describes the process of building, installing and running flashrom on Ubuntu 22.04. Deploy using Dasharo Tools Suite For simplicity we recommend using Dasharo Tools Suite to omit all compilation steps and deploy the Dasharo firmware seamlessly. Be sure to disable the BIOS lock in the AMI firmware setup utility: Go to Chipset tab Enter PCH IO Configuration Disable BIOS Lock . Save changes and reset. Now you are ready to use Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS): Boot Dasharo Tools Suite. Perform Dasharo installation. This will flash the full image, including the Intel ME. The operation requires a hard reset of the platform. To perform a hard reset: Power off the platform. Note, it may not power off completely due to flashed ME. Disconnect power supply from the board when OS finishes all tasks after power off (the screen goes dark or black). Disconnect the RTC/CMOS battery OR clear the CMOS using the pin header located near memory slots. Wait about 10 seconds and unshort the pins. Connect the power supply back. The platform should power on normally now. You can connect the battery back if it was disconnected. This concludes Dasharo deployment process using DTS. Build flashrom Please follow generic guide for Dasharo flashrom fork . Reading flash contents Always prepare a backup of the current firmware image. To read from the flash and save them to a file ( dump.rom ), execute the following command: flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom Keep the backup for later recovery if needed. Flashing Dasharo To flash Dasharo on the platform, execute the following command - replace [path] with the path to the Dasharo image you want to flash, e.g. protectli_vault_glk_v1.0.15.rom . If stock firmware is currently installed: flashrom -p internal -w [ path ] If Dasharo is currently installed, only the COREBOOT and IFWI partitions of the flash needs to be updated.

If there is little thermal paste on the CPU, apply it before reassembling the motherboard to the platform cover. Match pin 1(CS) on the Pomona clip with the first pin of the one of flash chip, marked with a small dot engraved on the chip.","title":"Connections"},{"location":"variants/protectli_vp2410/recovery/#firmware-flashing","text":"To flash firmware follow the steps described below: Login to RTE via ssh or minicom . Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply. Wait at least 5 seconds. Turn off the platform by using the power button. Wait at least 3 seconds. Set the proper state of the SPI by using the following commands on RTE: # set SPI Vcc to 1.8V echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio405/value # SPI Vcc on echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value # SPI lines ON echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value Wait at least 2 seconds. Disconnect the power supply from the platform. Wait at least 2 seconds. Flash the platform by using the following command: flashrom -p linux_spi:dev = /dev/spidev1.0,spispeed = 16000 -c \"MX25U6435E/F\" -w [ path_to_binary ] Flashing with flashrom takes about 1 minute. Change back the state of the SPI by using the following commands: echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value Reset CMOS, this can be done by two methods: Disconnect the CMOS battery, wait at least 10 seconds and connect again. Short the two pins from the CMOS header for at least 10 seconds. Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply. The first boot of the platform after proceeding with the above procedure can take much longer than standard.","title":"Firmware flashing"},{"location":"variants/protectli_vp2410/releases/","text":"Release Notes Following Release Notes describe status of open-source firmware development for Protectli VP2410 family.

Prerequisites Prepared RTE SOIC-8 Pomona clip 6x female-female wire cables Connections To prepare the stand for flashing follow the steps described below: Connect the wire cables to the Pomona clip. Connect the Pomona clip to the SPI header on RTE. SPI header Pomona clip Vcc pin 5 (Vcc) GND pin 4 (GND) CS pin 1 (CS) SCLK pin 7 (CLK) MISO pin 2 (MISO) MOSI pin 8 (MOSI) Open the platform cover. Match pin 1(CS) on the Pomona clip with the first pin of the one of flash chip, marked with a small dot engraved on the chip. Firmware flashing To flash firmware follow the steps described below: Login to RTE via ssh or minicom . Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply. Wait at least 5 seconds. Turn off the platform by using the power button. Wait at least 3 seconds. Set the proper state of the SPI by using the following commands on RTE: # set SPI Vcc to 3.3V echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio405/value # SPI Vcc on echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value # SPI lines ON echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value Wait at least 2 seconds. Disconnect the power supply from the platform. Wait at least 2 seconds. Flash the platform by using the following command: flashrom -p linux_spi:dev = /dev/spidev1.0,spispeed = 16000 -c \"MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E\" -w [ path_to_binary ] Flashing with flashrom takes about 1 minute. Change back the state of the SPI by using the following commands: echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value Reset CMOS, this can be done by two methods: Disconnect the CMOS battery, wait at least 10 seconds and connect again. Short the two pins from the CMOS header for at least 10 seconds. Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply.

Change back the state of the SPI by using the following commands: echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value Reset CMOS, this can be done by two methods: Disconnect the CMOS battery, wait at least 10 seconds and connect again. Short the two pins from the CMOS header for at least 10 seconds. Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply. The first boot of the platform after proceeding with the above procedure can take much longer than standard.","title":"Firmware flashing"},{"location":"variants/protectli_vp2420/releases/","text":"Release Notes Following Release Notes describe status of open-source firmware development for Protectli VP2420 family.

This document describes the process of building, installing and running flashrom on Ubuntu 22.04. Deploy using Dasharo Tools Suite For simplicity we recommend using Dasharo Tools Suite to omit all compilation steps and deploy the Dasharo firmware seamlessly. Be sure to disable the BIOS lock in the AMI firmware setup utility: Go to Chipset tab Enter PCH IO Configuration Disable BIOS Lock . Save changes and reset. Now you are ready to use Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS): Boot Dasharo Tools Suite. Perform Dasharo installation. This will flash the full image, including the Intel ME. The operation requires a hard reset of the platform. To perform a hard reset: Power off the platform. Note, it may not power off completely due to flashed ME. Disconnect power supply from the board when OS finishes all tasks after power off (the screen goes dark or black). Disconnect the RTC/CMOS battery OR clear the CMOS using the pin header located near memory slots. Wait about 10 seconds and unshort the pins. Connect the power supply back. The platform should power on normally now. You can connect the battery back if it was disconnected. This concludes Dasharo deployment process using DTS. Build flashrom Please follow generic guide for Dasharo flashrom fork . Reading flash contents Always prepare a backup of the current firmware image. To read from the flash and save it to a file ( dump.rom ), execute the following command: flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom Flashing Dasharo To flash Dasharo on the platform, execute the following command - replace [path] with the path to the Dasharo image you want to flash, e.g. protectli_vault_cml_v1.0.13.rom . flashrom -p internal -w protectli_vault_cml_v1.0.13.rom This will flash the full image, including the Intel ME. The operation requires a hard reset of the platform. To perform a hard reset: Power off the platform. Note, it may not power off completely due to flashed ME. Disconnect power supply from the board when OS finishes all tasks after power off (the screen goes dark or black).

The operation requires a hard reset of the platform. To perform a hard reset: Power off the platform. Note, it may not power off completely due to flashed ME. Disconnect power supply from the board when OS finishes all tasks after power off (the screen goes dark or black). Disconnect the RTC/CMOS battery OR clear the CMOS using the pin header located near memory slots. Wait about 10 seconds and unshort the pins. Connect the power supply back.

Prerequisites Prepared RTE SOIC-8 Pomona clip 6x female-female wire cables Connections To prepare the stand for flashing follow the steps described below: Connect the wire cables to the Pomona clip. Connect the Pomona clip to the SPI header on RTE. SPI header Pomona clip Vcc pin 5 (Vcc) GND pin 4 (GND) CS pin 1 (CS) SCLK pin 7 (CLK) MISO pin 2 (MISO) MOSI pin 8 (MOSI) Open the platform cover. Match pin 1(CS) on the Pomona clip with the first pin of the flash chip, marked with a small dot engraved on the chip. Firmware flashing To flash firmware follow the steps described below: Login to RTE via ssh or minicom . Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply. Wait at least 5 seconds. Turn off the platform by using the power button. Wait at least 3 seconds. Set the proper state of the SPI by using the following commands on RTE: # set SPI Vcc to 3.3V echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio405/value # SPI Vcc on echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value # SPI lines ON echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value Wait at least 2 seconds. Disconnect the power supply from the platform. Wait at least 2 seconds. Flash the platform by using the following command: flashrom -p linux_spi:dev = /dev/spidev1.0,spispeed = 16000 -c \"MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E\" -w [ path_to_binary ] Flashing with flashrom takes about 1 minute. Change back the state of the SPI by using the following commands: echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value Reset CMOS, this can be done by two methods: Disconnect the CMOS battery, wait at least 10 seconds and connect again. Short the two pins from the CMOS header for at least 10 seconds. Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply. The first boot of the platform after proceeding with the above procedure can take much longer than standard.","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"variants/protectli_vp46xx/recovery/#recovery","text":"","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"variants/protectli_vp46xx/recovery/#intro","text":"The following documentation describes the process of recovering hardware from the brick state with RTE and Dasharo open-source firmware.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"variants/protectli_vp46xx/recovery/#prerequisites","text":"Prepared RTE SOIC-8 Pomona clip 6x female-female wire cables","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"variants/protectli_vp46xx/recovery/#connections","text":"To prepare the stand for flashing follow the steps described below: Connect the wire cables to the Pomona clip.

Hardware preparation Please use Supermicro Quick Reference Guide for you mainboard e.g. X11SSH-TF . Find JPME2 and change its state to position 2-3, which means ME Manufacturing Mode enabled. Booting DTS over network For seamless and storageless deployment one can use BMC virtual floppy functionality to mount a floppy image containing iPXE. iPXE will allow to boot DTS over network without much effort. The image file can be downloaded from 3mdeb FTP server . If you wish to build the image, please follow instructions in Building iPXE floppy image section. To boot from the iPXE image, please do the following: Download or build the iPXE image on your host machine. Log in to the BMC dashboard. Select the floppy image through Browse button: Upload image to the BMC in the Virtual Media panel, by clicking Upload : Go to Remote Control -> iKVM/HTML5 and start iKVM/HTML5 remote control window.

Testing firmware images without flashing BMC firmware v2.00+ allows testing new firmware images without flashing the physical flash device. This makes testing and switching between two versions (e.g. Hostboot and coreboot) much faster and safer. There are two ways of doing so, here's a more convenient one that uses mboxctl : Read original flash: For earlier versions of coreboot port it is required to read from system that booted at least once, since some of the partitions are modified on the first boot. this is no longer necessary since v0.5.0. root@talos:~# pflash -r /tmp/talos.pnor This file may also be copied out of BMC to a secure place and serve as a backup of whole flash contents. Keep in mind that tmpfs size is limited and exceeding that limit may result in unresponsive BMC, which in most severe cases requires hard power cycle. \"Flashing\" modified partition(s): This is similar to flashing real device with two changes: no need to erase the flash and target file must be specified. New command looks like this: root@talos:~# pflash -f -P <partition> -p <partition>.bin -F /tmp/talos.pnor Since the real flash device is not used, backup can be skipped. The rest is like above: # bootblock pflash -f -P HBB -p /tmp/bootblock.signed.ecc -F /tmp/talos.pnor # coreboot pflash -f -P HBI -p /tmp/coreboot.rom.signed.ecc -F /tmp/talos.pnor # Heads pflash -f -P BOOTKERNEL -p /tmp/zImage.bundled -F /tmp/talos.pnor Mount the file as flash device: root@talos:~# mboxctl --backend file:/tmp/talos.pnor Sometimes this command fails with timeout, in that case repeat it until it succeeds. Optionally, success can be tested with: root@talos:~# mboxctl --lpc-state LPC Bus Maps: BMC Memory BMC Memory tells that emulated flash is used instead of real one. Host doesn't see any difference (except maybe different access times and erase block size), it still reads and writes PNOR the same way as with physical device. Start the platform as described in previous sections and test it. To get back to using real PNOR: root@talos:~# mboxctl --backend vpnor Failed to post message: Connection timed out root@talos:~# mboxctl --lpc-state LPC Bus Maps: Flash Device Even though that command reports failure, it maps LPC back to flash device. This can be tested with mboxctl --lpc-state . (Optional) Flash tested image to permanent storage: root@talos:~# pflash -E -p /tmp/talos.pnor The other method is described on Raptor's wiki and requires starting mboxd manually (still needs BMC firmware v2.00+).

This document describes the process of building, installing and running flashrom on Ubuntu 20.04. Build flashrom Please follow generic guide for Dasharo flashrom fork . Reading flash contents To read from the flash and save them to a file ( dump.rom ), execute the following command: flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom Installing Dasharo Initial Installation During the initial installation of Dasharo, you will need the supported Intel ME version (and configuration) to be present in the Dasharo firmware image. If you already have a Dasharo compatible ME firmware installed, then proceed with Updating Dasharo instructions . Publicly released binaries do not contain ME binary. If you need a Dasharo compatible Intel ME update for your device, contact us via already established commercial support channel. When flashing binaries with ME binary included, flashing of the whole chip is required. Follow the steps below: Power off the laptop While holding the Fn+M keys, power on the laptop - This unlocks the ME and allows for it to be overwritten. The fans will spin at 100% speed at this point Execute the following command, replacing [path] with the path to the full firmware image (containing ME firmware and flash descriptor) you want to flash: flashrom -p internal -w [ full_image ] Reboot the laptop The laptop will boot into Dasharo. After Dasharo has booted, it is safe to shut down the laptop to silence the fans Note: if you shut down the laptop instead of rebooting, it may be necessary to hold Fn+M for it to boot the first time after flashing. Updating Dasharo If Dasharo is currently installed, only the BIOS region of the flash needs to be updated. Flash it using the following command: flashrom -p internal -w [ path ] --ifd -i bios","title":"Installation manual"},{"location":"variants/tuxedo_ibs15/installation/#dasharo-for-tuxedo-ibs15-gen6-installation-manual","text":"","title":"Dasharo for Tuxedo IBS15 Gen6 - Installation manual"},{"location":"variants/tuxedo_ibs15/installation/#intro","text":"Flashing coreboot can be done from Linux using flashrom with the internal programmer.
